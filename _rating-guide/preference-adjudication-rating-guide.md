For applicants who proceed through both assessment interviews, transmute the interview assessment ratings into a final overall passing score to determine the category where they should be placed (before preferences are applied).

**NOTE:** Applicants who do not receive a combination of 4s and 5s are not placed in a category as they did not achieve an overall passing score.

| Interview Ratings | Resulting Points | Category |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Two 4s | 70 | Qualified |
| One 4, One 5 | 85 (average of 70 and 100) | Well Qualified |
| Two 5s | 100 | Best Qualified |
