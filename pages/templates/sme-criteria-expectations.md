title: SME Criteria and Expectations
---

This document assumes assignment of 6 SMEs assessing 100 applicants. Estimates will vary depending on how many applicants move forward during each step of the process.

## Criteria for Participation

- The SMEs should submit their bio and resume as part of the selection process so that this information can be documented in the case file for the application process.
- The SMEs should go through a selection process established by the Hiring Manager and HR Specialist to ensure that the SMEs are best suited to conduct the reviews of other people applying to that position at that grade. The Hiring Manager should select SMEs who excel in their position and would do a good job determining and assessing an applicant's qualifications.
- These SMEs cannot apply for the job that's posted. They must also sign confidentiality agreements to protect all testing material they help create.

## Estimated Time Required and Dates

These activities will take place within a 2-month time span:

- **Job Analysis:** The SMEs will spend up to 16 hours within one week to complete the job analysis exercises that determine the requirements they'll use to assess applicants during resume review and interviews. This will include creating competencies, proficiency levels, and structured interview questions. Ideally all of the SMEs conducting the assessments will take place in the job analysis, though this is not requried. These exercises work best when all the SMEs are physically located in the same location.
- **Follow-up:** The following week, a subset of these SMEs will spend up to four hours composing the language for the job announcement with HR and practicing/refining the interview questions developed during Job Analysis.
- **Resume Review Training:** When the resumes are ready to be reviewed, the SMEs wil first attend a 2-hour resume review training followed by 1-hour of reviewing actual resumes in thier list with HR present to answer questions.  
- **Resume Review:** HR will divide applicants into two stored lists and two SMEs will be assigned to each list. They will have 4 days to review all the resumes in their list. Each resume requires two reviews.
- **Resume Review Tiebreaker** An additional SME will be assigned to each stored list to break any ties over a two day period.
- **Interview Training** While interviews are being scheduled, HR will conduct a 2-hour interview training required for all SMEs. This will cover how to conduct structured interviews and how to input results into the talent aquisiton system.
- **Phone Interviews Round One - Breadth of Competencies** Four SMEs will contribute up to 20 hours each over a two week period. This assumes 1-hour interviews with 45 minutes to complete the interview rating sheet and upload feedback into USA Staffing. The time required will vary based on how many applicants moved forward past the resume review stage.
- **Phone Interviews Round Two - Depth of Competencies:** Two SMEs will contribute up to 20 hours each over a two week period. This assumes 1 hour interviews with 45 minutes to complete the interview rating sheet and upload feedback into USA Staffing. The time required will vary based on how many applicants moved forward past the first interview.
- **Tie Breaking Interview Round:** A short tie-breaking round will be needed if the first two SMEs could not come to a conclusion. SMEs from each round will join a conference call with HR to decide if the applicant should move forward.
