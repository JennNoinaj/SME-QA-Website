## Where we are in the process

HHS posted [a job announcement](https://www.usajobs.gov/GetJob/ViewDetails/529652500) for IT Specialists on Friday April 5th, 2019. It covered 4 roles:

The announcement closed on Saturday April 6th after receiving 167 applications. Each application was reviewed by two Subject-Matter-Experts (SMEs). Any disagreements were then reviewed by a third SME before moving forward.
