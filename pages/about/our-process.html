          In the typical competitive delegated examining hiring process, HR specialists review resumes and occupational questionnaires to determine that applicants are minimally qualified. Hiring managers often know that qualified people have applied for their open role, but receive delegated examining certificates without truly qualified applicants to select. The Competitive Hiring Pilot introduces subject matter experts (SMEs), in partnership with HR specialists as guides, to create and conduct interview assessments before an applicant is considered qualified. HR specialists protect merit principles and ensure that participants the documented assessment strategy is applied consistently.

      <h2>How our process is different</h2>
      <p>
        Applicants who receive a passing score after multiple professionally developed SME assessments are rated and placed on the certificate of eligibles (following current veterans' preference and category rating rules) by HR. While OPM encourages IO Psychologists to professionally develop assessments, this pilot will have SMEs, HR, and the Hiring Manager coming together to professionally develop the competencies, proficiency levels, and structured interview questions that will define the assessments. If the agency has available IO Psychologists, they should be encouraged to participate.
