intro: Though applicant volume from usajobs.gov often convinces agencies that they do not need to recruit, this process is meant to utilize SMEs to fill multiple roles at an agency. The agency should always have a recruitment plan in place outside of “post and pray” on USAJOBS. This plan can including tweeting about the announcement on social media and targeting a minimum of 3 private sector job boards.

## Planning Recruitment

Use and measure the results for these techniques from The U.S. Digital Service (USDS) and The Lab at OPM to develop your short-term and long-term recruiting strategies.

### Developing a Talent Pipeline Strategy

To get the best people for your technical positions, develop a long-term talent pipeline strategy to tell prospective applicants about your agency and the types of work you typically do.

1.  **Attend technology conferences.**

Both USDS and The Lab at OPM encourage staff to participate in tech events both in the DC area and across the country. In order for this to be successful, both groups do what they can to remove friction so that staff can talk about their government work as freely as possible. USDS uses consistent media outreach, blog posts, and social media activity to help raise their profile, and while this takes time and effort to establish, it has paid off.

2.  **Cultivate relationships with well connected individuals.**

The Lab maintains a list of both designers and people interested in civic tech with large networks and audiences. They routinely reach out to these people when there's a job posting to ask them to mention it on Twitter, their blog, LinkedIn page, or even an email to their network.

3.  **Engage with local professional affinity groups.**

If SMEs are members of local meet-ups or other communities, encourage them to share your job announcement there. For example, see these popular D.C. technology events and communities:

-   [D.C. area Drupal meetup group Slack channel](https://www.meetup.com/drupal-dc/messages/archive/)
-   [D.C. Tech (Rails and JS heavy)](https://www.meetup.com/DC-Tech-Meetup/discussions/)
-   [D.C. Agile Software testing group](https://www.meetup.com/dcast-io/discussions/)
-   [Code for D.C.](https://www.meetup.com/Code-for-DC/discussions/)
-   [Refresh D.C.](https://refresh-dc.org/) - A community of web designers, developers, and other new media professionals working together to refresh the creative, technical, and professional aspects of their trades in the Washington, D.C. area.

## Recruiting For Your Current Roles

When you have positions ready to be announced, plan where you'll advertise the opportunities to attract the best talent based on your needs.

1.  **Post to free and popular targeted job boards**

If you have access to paid job boards, then absolutely use those resources, but consider also finding popular job boards targeted to the audience you are trying to reach. See "[Popular Technology Job Boards](#popular-technology-job-boards)" for some ideas.

2.  **Answer questions about your job posting via email or phone**

Both USDS and The Lab have tasked a panel of people involved in the hiring action with answering questions over a conference call. Include the time and phone number for the pre-scheduled call in your job announcement, along with an explanation of the types of questions you'll cover. For example:

> To address questions about the application process and requirements, `{YOUR OFFICE}` will offer several optional phone calls during the application period for this position. For details about the timing of those calls and how to participate, see <https://www.eventbrite.com/o/[id]>."

While these calls don't help attract applicants, they improve the applicant experience by narrowing the pool to truly interested applicants who need specific answers to stay in contention. If scheduled calls are too much for your group, simply include a phone number or email address that would be staffed  as long as the job is posted, beginning the day your job opens.

3.  **Personal and professional referrals**

Good old fashioned networking is still extremely effective. Mention positions to your internal networks and ask them to reach out to *their* networks to encourage people to apply.

4.  **Resume mining**

The Agency Talent Portal from USAJOBS allows you to search over a million resumes. To request an account, write to <a href="mailto:recruiter-help@usajobs.gov">recruiter-help@usajobs.gov</a>.
