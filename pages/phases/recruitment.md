intro: Now that you have a job announcement posted you will need to let applicants know that it exists. Relying on usajobs.gov to attract applicants is known as the "post and pray" model of recruitment and it is ineffective. We highly recommend that you develop a recruitment strategy and use the resources below to reach applicants where they are.

## Strategy

### Short-term

#### 1. Post to free and popular, targeted job boards, such as Code for America and Hacker News.

Options are listed below. If you have access to paid job boards, then absolutely use those resources as well, but consider also finding job boards targeted to the audience you are trying to reach.

#### 2. Answer questions about the job posting via email or phone.

Both USDS and The Lab have used a panel of people involved in the hiring action tasked with answering questions over a conference call. Include the time and phone number for that call into your job announcement and explain which kinds of questions will be answered. For example:

> To address questions about the application process and requirements, [your office] will offer several optional "office hours" phone calls during the application period for this position. More details about the timing of those calls and how to participate can be found here: <https://www.eventbrite.com/o/[id]>"

At the very least include a phone number or email address that would be staffed and answered on the day your job opens and ideally as long as the job remained open.

While this doesn’t help attract applicants it has helped narrow the pool and helped folks who were qualified get answers and thus stay in contention. It improves the applicant experience.

#### 3. Referrals

Definitely hit up your internal networks to reach out to their networks and encourage them to apply.

#### 4. Resume mining

If you don't already have an account with the Agency Talent Portal from USAJOBS, which allows you to search over a million resumes, write to <a href="mailto:recruiter-help@usajobs.gov">recruiter-help@usajobs.gov</a> to request an account.

### Long-term

#### 1. Attend Technology conferences

What USDS and The Lab have found helpful is to encourage staff to participate in tech conferences and to help remove friction so that they can talk about their work. Staff members often attend or speak at events both in the DC area and across the country. USDS in particular has consistent PR, blog posts, etc. that help raise their profile. That’s what has worked. Clearly that takes time and effort to establish, but it does pay off.

#### 2. Cultivate relationships with well connected individuals

The Lab has a list of designers and other individuals interested in the public sector who have big networks. We routinely reach out to them when we have a job posting and ask them to post it on their Twitter feed, blog, LinkedIn page, or just email their network.

#### 3. Subject-matter-experts reach out to their local affinity groups

If SMEs are members of local Meet-up or other groups they should be encouraged to post the announcement there. The list below is a start.

## Resources

### Job boards

#### 1. Code for America job board

<https://jobs.codeforamerica.org/job-postings/new>

It’s free and it will hit an interested audience. The current job postings there are mostly design & software development. However, if that is not exactly what you are looking for it may in fact help your job stand out. Regardless, the number of jobs posted here at one one time is not overwhelming.

#### 2. Hacker News

<https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19543940>

Hacker News is another great resource that has yielded results for USDS. They post “Who is hiring” on the 1st of each month, so if you can time your posting to be open on or right after the 1st of the month then great. Otherwise it is still worth doing but may have less of an impact.

#### 3. OpenGov jobs

<https://www.opengovjobs.org/>

Announcements to this group are appropriate if you are supportive of openness (e.g. open data, open processes, etc.) and accountability. Which we hope you are.

#### 4. Design Gigs for Good

<https://designgigsforgood.squarespace.com/>

Obviously this is specific to design, however it is a well curated list from former USDS members.

#### 5. Women who code

<https://www.womenwhocode.com/>

Job postings are $200 but this reaches a specific, under represented, and valuable community.


### Meet-ups

Encouraging your SMEs to attend local meet-ups is an excellent way for them to connect with potential applicants. Here are some in the DMV area that we feel are worth considering, but there are many others worth looking into on [Meet-up.com](https://www.meetup.com/).

-   [DC area Drupal meetup group Slack channel](https://www.meetup.com/drupal-dc/messages/archive/)
-   [DC Tech (Rails and JS heavy)](https://www.meetup.com/DC-Tech-Meetup/discussions/)
-   [DC Agile Software testing group](https://www.meetup.com/dcast-io/discussions/)
-   [Code for DC](https://www.meetup.com/Code-for-DC/discussions/)
-   [Refresh DC](https://refresh-dc.org/) - A community of web designers, developers, and other new media professionals working together to refresh the creative, technical, and professional aspects of their trades in the Washington, DC, area.
