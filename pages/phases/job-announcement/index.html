title: Job announcement
sidenav: hiring-phases
intro: Qualified job seekers often don't have enough information to make an informed decision to apply based on job announcements with language taken directly from the position description. To attract the most qualified applicants, your job announcement must be an accurate and compelling representation of the position. In addition, agencies receive high applicant volume from USAJOBS, convincing them that it's unnecessary to recruit for their positions. To attract the excellent applicants who don't typically search USAJOBS, plan where you'll advertise your opportunities before the job is posted.
roles: [hr, hiring-mgr]
duration: 3-4 hours
outputs:
  - Job announcement content to publish on USAJOBS
  - Recruitment strategy for your role(s)
