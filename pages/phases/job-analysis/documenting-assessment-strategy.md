title: Documenting Your Assessment Strategy
intro: In addition to documenting job tasks, developing core competencies and proficiencies, and creating interview assessment questions, ask SMEs participating in your workshop to make these key decisions about the assessment strategy they'll use for your hiring action.

  Include the specifics of these decisions in both your assessment strategy document and your <a href="../../job-announcement/">job announcement</a>.

<h3 id="resume-review-page-count">Number of reviewed resume work experience pages</h3>
<p>
  While private sector guidance for writing resumes recommends shorter resumes, federal-style resumes can be anywhere from 10 to 100 pages long. These lengths take longer for SMEs to review in order to find evidence of the required competencies. In addition, shorter, more brief private sector resumes can unwittingly bias an SME to think that there's not enough information to make a determination.
</p>
<p>
  To mitigate these issues, ask SMEs <strong>how many pages of work experience they will review on each resume applicants submit</strong>. We recommend limiting reviewed pages to two or three at most. If an applicant submits a longer resume, they will not be penalized; rather, SMEs will simply not review past the documented limit.
</p>

<h3>Tech recency requirements</h3>
<p>
  Technology changes quickly, and depending on the needs of your agency, SMEs may determine that applicants should demonstrate knowledge of modern technical methods, platforms, and languages within a certain number of the most recent years. We recommend that this type of technical recency be documented at between three and five years.
