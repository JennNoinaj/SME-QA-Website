title: Job analysis workshop
sidenav: hiring-phases
intro: Conduct a two-day job analysis workshop with SMEs to professionally develop your assessments. During the workshop, you’ll help SMEs identify and define the required competencies and proficiency levels for the position, as well as write two sets of structured interview questions that can assess the required proficiency levels. SMEs will use these competencies, proficiency levels, and related questions during interview assessments to determine whether applicants meet the technical qualifications for the job before applicants are considered qualified and eligible for veterans’ preference. You’ll also be able to develop an accurate job description with the information from the job analysis workshop.
roles: [Human Resources, Subject-Matter-Experts, Hiring Managers, IO Psychologist]
duration: 2-days (16 hours)
outputs:
  - 4-6 core competencies and their definitions
  - Proficiency descriptions for each competency, including the proficiency required for the hiring action
  - First phone interview assessment questions (covering breadth of knowledge) and good sample responses
  - Second phone interview assessment questions (covering depth of knowledge) and good sample responses
  - Job analysis worksheet (for hiring action case file)

## About Core Competencies

Before beginning a hiring action, your group must have a shared understanding of the essential qualities an applicant must possess to be successful in performing the duties for a given role. By defining these *core competencies*, your group will form the basis of how you:

- Describe your role to applicants in your job announcement.
- Assess applicant resumes to determine whether they receive a technical interview.
- Develop technical interview questions and conduct those interviews with applicants.

### Competencies for Specialized Roles or Parentheticals

In some cases, your agency may choose to gather more specialized roles, sometimes called *parentheticals*, together within the same hiring action. In order to assess whether an applicant is qualified for these more specialized roles, you define an additional role-specific competency that describes the necessary technical qualities for a person performing that role.

To be considered for that role, an applicant must meet or exceed *all core competencies* for the announcement, in addition to the role- or parenthetical-specific competency. It's impossible to move an applicant forward who did not meet or exceed all core competencies for a parenthetical.

## Conducting a Job Analysis Workshop

If you haven't already defined your core competencies, you'll bring together SMEs, HR specialists, and hiring managers to develop them, along with proficiency levels and structured interview questions that define their technical assessments. SMEs will use these competencies to conduct technical evaluation during the process. If the agency has an IO Psychologist, they should also attend this workshop.

We recommend taking two days for HR, representative SMEs in the role of the job being hired for, and the hiring manager(s) to come together to decide competencies, proficiency levels, and interview questions for the assessment process.

## Write Down Job Tasks

To facilitate this exercise, give each participant a stack of sticky notes and ask them to write down each duty on a separate note as they think of them. For larger groups, you can divide the participants into teams. The tasks should begin with a verb, indicating that they’re an action a person in that position would actively take or has taken recently. A broad statement like "Manages stakeholders" should be broken up into more specific tasks like "Sent emails updating stakeholders on the project to avoid miscommunication" and "Organized one on one meeting with higher level stakeholders to make sure everyone is on the same page."

## Converting Job Tasks to Competencies

As the group adds duties to a wall in the room, start to cluster them into groups of tasks that are similar to each other. When the clusters are adequately organized, brainstorm a broad title for each group. These titles are the competencies required to do the job.

The group can be given dot stickers to vote on 3-4 competencies per person in order to get a sense of which are the most important competencies for this position. The results of the votes, plus the frequency of the post its per competency category, can help the group determine how to weight the importance of the competencies. The group may end up with 4-5 required competencies for the position, all required to be minimally qualified, but may determine that exceeding the proficiency requirement for one of those would be required in order to be considered "best qualified" for the position.

## Defining Competencies

Because resume reviewers and interviewers must be able to clearly and objectively evaluate a competency, you should create competencies by specifying _how you know_ if an applicant has that skill. What would you expect them to have done in the past? What would you expect them to know, and at what level of detail?

For example, the tasks might be:

- Responded effectively to customer requests and customer-related incidents.
- Negotiated procurement with technology vendors.
- Coordinated between management and IT for IT projects.

But the competency could be:

> *Stakeholder Engagement: Cultivates relationships with key internal and external stakeholders. Has superior negotiation skills that enable successful communication and cooperation across all levels of an organization, including executive leadership.*

The competency explanation should be limited to 1-3 sentences and avoid a laundry list of specific tasks. This explanation will appear in the job announcement under qualifications and will be how the applicants will be assessed by subject matter experts.

## About Proficiency Levels

Next, we use proficiency levels to describe how advanced a given applicant is in that competency. We recommend using the levels _Unfamiliar_, _Familiar_, _Experienced_, and _Master_.

The situations you describe to define the proficiency levels should be consistent. The proficiency levels should involve these types of differences:

* **Scale of activity:** The applicant did something at a small organization _-vs-_ did something at a large organization.
* **Seniority:** The applicant did something as part of a group _-vs-_ lead the group that did something.
* **Level of detail:** The applicant can explain a general concept _-vs-_ can discuss the concept in detail.

## Defining Minimum Qualifications From Competencies

When you've defined the competencies and their proficiency levels, establish minimum qualifications for the position.The same set of competencies can be used for different positions because roles that require more seniority set the minimum qualification bar higher than more junior roles.

## Creating a Structured Interview from Competencies

Scope interview questions so that they focus on either the _breadth_ or _depth_ of the applicant's knowledge.

### Breadth vs Depth Questions

The first interview should test the applicant's _breadth of experience_ across as many competencies as possible. Breadth questions test if an applicant has experience, knowledge, or exposure to a general topic. Limit follow up questions to basic probe questions (i.e., "What was your role?" or "Can you tell me more?"). Breadth questions tend to take five to ten minutes to answer, including any follow-up questions.

The second interview should test the applicant's _depth of knowledge_ about the competencies. Depth questions test how an applicant reacts and responds to changes in the presented situation. Mandated follow up questions that probe deeper (i.e., "Now imagine..." or "Tell me about a time you've experienced that hypothetical in real life."). Depth questions can take up to 10-15 minutes for an applicant to answer.

### Question Formats

Good interview questions tend to follow similar patterns. We've assembled some of these formats for reference.

#### Past Experience

Ask the applicant for a story from their work experience that describes the required level of proficiency. A qualified applicant will give specific and detailed answers, including the events leading up to the story, why they made the decisions they did, the lessons they learned, and what they would do differently.

> "Tell me about a time..."

#### Hypothetical Situation

Give the applicant a situation they are likely to encounter in the role you're interviewing for. Ask them to analyze what might be the cause, develop a plan or solution, or describe the pros and cons of a proposed approach. The setup to this question may be longer than other types and might be based on real challenges their organization has faced in the past. When you create a question from real events, make sure the problem has already been solved so you can correctly assess the applicant's answer and provide additional details as needed.

> "Imagine we have a problem with..."

#### Applicant Viewpoints

Ask the applicant's opinion about an issue with different schools of thought. Assess the applicant on their ability to justify their perspective, or if they lack a strong preference one way or other, to identify and contrast different opinions.

> "What do you think about..."

Avoid these types of questions:

- **Brain teasers or puzzles:** These create stress for the applicant and don't test their skills.
- **Self-assessing strengths and weaknesses:** These create disingenuous answers that don't relate to competencies.
- **Questions about five year plans and future goals:** These don't test competencies and can reveal inappropriate information that introduces bias.
