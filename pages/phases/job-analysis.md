## About Core Competencies

Core competencies are the essential skills for performing a given role inside an organization. They directly relate to the skills and experience a candidate needs in order to be considered for a role, and also account for a range of proficiency levels. An organization can use the same competencies for a set of roles. Depending on seniority for a specific position, the organization can define qualifications by requiring different proficiency levels for those competencies.

Core competencies establish consistency and mitigate bias, especially across different posted positions for the same role over time. When interviewers share a common language for their feedback to a hiring manager and HR, candidates are more likely to be evaluated on the same agreed upon criteria.

Defining both the competencies for a role and the proficiency levels should happen as part of the Job Analysis stage of the hiring process. Part of that process should include establishing clearly which proficiency level at each competency is necessary for a candidate to be minimally qualified for the position. A candidate doesn't need the highest level of proficiency in all competencies! An organization may determine that one competency requires master proficiency, two require only experience, and for all others, a qualified candidate need only demonstrate familiarity. A more senior position at the same organization may require two master levels, four require experienced and two familiar.

## Completing a Job Analysis

To begin creating core competencies, the hiring manager and at least two SMEs meet with HR and discuss the duties a qualified candidate will be expected to perform. We recommend creating affinity diagrams (<https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/affinity-diagrams-learn-how-to-cluster-and-bundle-ideas-and-facts>).

To facilitate an affinity diagramming exercise, give each participant a stack of sticky notes and ask them to write down each duty on a separate note as they think of them. For larger groups, you can divide the participants into teams. The tasks should begin with a verb, indicating that they’re an action a person in that position would actively take.

This example of tasks for a florist position demonstrates that the brainstormed duties are brief, but distinct where necessary:

-   Design floral and foliage arrangements
-   Work with clients to understand prices, dates, times, and places of delivery
-   Purchase flowers, foliage, and supplies from wholesalers
-   Pack and load arrangements for customers
-   Coordinate with deliverers
-   Input orders in POS software
-   Update stock daily in inventory management software
-   Open and close the store
-   Unload delivered supplies
-   Clean showroom and work area
-   Create advertisements
-   Distribute advertisements through local papers and online sites
-   Respond to inquiries online and by phone

## Converting Job Skills to Competencies

As the group adds duties to the board, start to cluster them into groups of tasks that are similar to each other. When the clusters are adequately organized, brainstorm a broad title for each group. These titles are the competencies required to do the job.

Because resume reviewers and interviewers must be able to clearly and objectively evaluate a competency, you should create competencies by specifying _how you know_ if a candidate has that skill. What would you expect them to have done in the past? What would you expect them to know, and at what level of detail?

For example, the skill might be:

> _Relationship Building_

But the competency would be:

> _Candidate has experience coordinating across organizational divisions. Candidate has run cross functional teams. Candidate has negotiated partnerships with other organizations._

## About Proficiency Levels

Next, we use proficiency levels to describe how advanced a given candidate is in that competency. We recommend using the levels _Unfamiliar_, _Familiar_, _Experienced_, and _Master_.

The situations you describe to define the proficiency levels should be consistent. The proficiency levels should involve these types of differences:

-   **Scale of activity:** The candidate did something at a small organization _-vs-_ did something at a large organization.
-   **Seniority:** The candidate did something as part of a group _-vs-_ lead the group that did something.
-   **Level of detail:** The candidate can explain a general concept _-vs-_ can discuss the concept in detail.

## Sample Competencies and Proficiency Levels

Use these examples to develop your own core competencies and proficiencies. While the formats differ, you can see that the common aspects are:

-   A useful, brief description of the competency.
-   Four proficiency levels for “Unfamiliar,” “Familiar,” “Experienced,” and “Master”.
-   A clear description of the possible proficiency an applicant would demonstrate for the given competency.

### Example Competency: Agency Hiring Staff for a Field Office

After working with SMEs and HR, the hiring manager determines that in order to be successful in a position, it's critical that the candidate can work remotely. The agency develops this competency:

| Proficiency Level | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| :---------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Unfamiliar**    | Candidate is uncomfortable working remotely. Does not understand how to set up equipment correctly. Does not make use of group chat in a professional environment.                                                                                                                       |
| **Familiar**      | Candidate has worked remotely in the past and demonstrates comfort with group chat, virtual collaboration tools, and web conferencing                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Experienced**   | Candidate has worked remotely in the past, is comfortable with the tools described for a _Familiar_ proficiency, and can articulate barriers to productivity that are unique to remote work (ie - distractions in a home office, collaborating across timezones, isolation, etc.).       |
| **Master**        | Candidate can articulate common problems with remote work and has strategies to mitigate those issues. Candidate has been involved in the selection of tools to facilitate remote work and can weigh the pros and cons of various approaches (Google Hangouts _-vs-_ Skype _-vs-_ Zoom). |

### Example Competency: Engineering Considerations

Works effectively with engineers as a true partner. Understands the technical stack of a product and how it can impact product design and project schedules. Considers the complexities involved in building technology at massive scale.

-   **Unfamiliar:** Has never worked with engineers, or has but not effectively/views them as a different group of people. Views technical matters as someone else's problem, and seems uninterested in learning more about a project's technical foundations. Unable to describe a project's technical stack.
-   **Familiar:** Has some experience working effectively with engineers. Displays a basic understanding that technical choices impact product design and project schedules. Shows an active interest in learning more about a project's technical foundations.
-   **Experienced:** Repeated track record of working as a true partner with engineers. Describes situations where they have engaged in technical decisions or shifted product or project plans due to technical issues. Understanding some of the complexities of building technology at massive scale.
-   **Master:** Functions as a true partner with engineers in all technical products and projects in which they are involved. Able to identify potential technical concerns with proposals before consulting engineers. Repeatedly engages in technical decisions and supports engineering needs.

### Example Competency: Information Architecture

Almost every design today involves organizing information, whether it's an online policies-and-procedures library, product information, or user-generated videos. Information architecture helps us organize that content in a way that makes it easy for users to hone in to the specific content they're seeking.

Skills include understanding methods for organizing information, such as taxonomies, folksonomies, facets, and ontologies; techniques for deriving user hierarchies, such as card sorting; and creating design deliverables, such as site maps.

-   **Unfamiliar:** Understood value of well-organized content and navigation. Participated in information architecture projects as a collaborator, under someone else's direction. No evidence of making information architecture decisions in professional project work. Demonstrated solid organizational skills.
-   **Familiar:** Adeptly created intermediate deliverables, such as site maps and wireframes. Has driven both content and navigation architecture on small projects. Used large-scale content delivery classification systems. Used IA-based user research techniques (such as card sorting) to refine taxonomy and content inventories.
-   **Experienced:** Created navigation for a sophisticated application. Oversaw the construction of a large information repository. Worked on implementation of large, unfederated search, using advanced navigation techniques, such as best bets. Shipped multiple releases on a variety of platforms.
-   **Master:** Oversaw the information architecture strategy for very large repositories. Provided information architecture leadership for a team of designers. Worked on a variety of very different projects. Trained non-designer team members on the basics of information architecture, so they could produce reasonable initial work.

## Defining Minimum Qualifications From Competencies

When you've defined the competencies and their proficiency levels, you next establish minimum qualifications for the position. To create the minimum qualifications, decide the necessary level of proficiency for each competency. The same set of competencies can be used for different positions because roles that require more seniority set the minimum qualification bar higher than more junior roles.

## Creating a Structured Interview from Competencies

When writing questions, you should be able to map the proficiency levels of the competencies to specific answers that candidates might give. Try to anticipate how a candidate might answer a question, and how details or insight of those answers increase between proficiency levels. Scope interview questions so that they focus on either the _breadth_ or _depth_ of the applicant's knowledge.

### Developing Breadth Questions

The first technical interview (TQ1) should test the candidate's _breadth of experience_ across as many competencies as possible. Some competencies can be tested as a secondary function of other questions. For example, if a position requires an Oral Communication competency, the candidate's ability to communicate clearly is tested by every interview question.

Breadth questions should take five to ten minutes for an applicant to respond to. If the question is situation-based, the problem or challenge should describe a small set of possible solutions and few ambiguities.

### Developing Depth Questions

The second technical interview (TQ2) should test the candidate's _depth of knowledge_ about the competencies that require the highest proficiency level, generally "Experienced" or "Master".

Depth questions can take up to 15-20 minutes for an applicant to answer well. These questions challenge the candidate to work through a problem or scenario. A depth question should reveal a candidate's thought process and require the candidate to consider details, assumptions, and ambiguities not initially specified. A depth question should not have one right answer but instead should demonstrate how a candidate uses their skills, knowledge, and experience to answer the question.

### Question Template

To get consistent results from each interview regardless of the SME who conducts it, document your interview questions. A structured question template:

-   Specifies how to phrase the questions
-   Ties the question to a competency
-   Suggests follow-up questions
-   Describes possible answers by proficiency level

Follow-up questions give the interviewer suggestions on how to probe for more information when the applicant has provided an answer that is correct but doesn't offer enough information to test the competency. For example, an applicant might use terminology in a way that makes it hard to determine whether or not they actually understand the correct usage of the term. They are not wrong, but their phrasing is ambiguous. Develop follow-up questions that might clarify these types of ambiguities.

### Question Formats

Good interview questions tend to follow similar patterns. We've assembled some of these formats for reference.

Avoid these types of questions:

-   **Brain teasers or puzzles:** These create stress for the candidate and don't test their skills.
-   **Self-assessing strengths and weaknesses:** These create disingenuous answers that don't relate to competencies.
-   **Questions about five year plans and future goals:** These don't test competencies and can reveal inappropriate information that introduces bias.

#### Past Experience

Ask the applicant for a story from their work experience that describes the required level of proficiency. A qualified applicant will give specific and detailed answers, including the events leading up to the story, why they made the decisions they did, the lessons they learned, and what they would do differently.

-   **TQ1 Version:** The question focuses on a specific result, either positive or negative, and asks the applicant to describe the events that contributed to that result, both their own actions and factors beyond their control.

> "Tell me about a time when you missed a deadline."

-   **TQ2 Version:** The question focuses on an action or a feeling and asks the candidate to describe the events that led up to that moment but also how they reacted, what decisions they made as a result and how they feel about the outcome in retrospect. "Tell me about a hard problem you've dealt with" is a good example. A great answer requires the candidate to both describe the problem and discuss whether it was solved, how it was solved, why the candidate thought it was hard in the first place, and would they solve it differently today.

> "Tell me about a time you failed at something."

#### Hypothetical Situation

Give the candidate a situation they are likely to encounter in the role you're interviewing for. Ask them to analyze what might be the cause, develop a plan or solution, or describe the pros and cons of a proposed approach. The setup to this question may be longer than other types and might be based on real challenges their organization has faced in the past. When you create a question from real events, make sure the problem has already been solved so you can correctly assess the candidate's answer and provide additional details as needed.

-   **TQ1 Version:** You know what the problem is and want the candidate to develop a solution. There are only a few possible solutions and the applicant's answer is determined by their ability to describe those solutions and trade-offs to various approaches, if any exist.

> "We recently upgraded all of our routers but our WiFi speeds are still slow..."

-   **TQ2 Version:** You know the effects of the problem, but don't know the root cause. The applicant's answer is determined by their ability to dig for information, describe possible causes, narrow them down to the most likely, and outline solutions based on each potential case.

> "We have a problem with the speed of our network..."

#### Candidate Viewpoints

Ask the candidate's opinion about an issue with different schools of thought. Assess the applicant on their ability to justify their perspective, or if they lack a strong preference one way or other, to identify and contrast different opinions.

-   **TQ1 Version:** The issue has clearly defined schools of thought or a limited set of options. For example, the question "How would you pick a version control system?" is contained because there are a finite number of version control systems.

> "Microsoft 365 or Google Apps, which one is better and why?"

-   **TQ2 Version:** Ask the candidate to create criteria that distinguish between otherwise ambiguous concepts. A question like "What makes a great manager?" requires the candidate to separate the output of good managers from great managers, justify that distinction, and then associate the results with a set of behaviors and habits.

> "What makes a high performing team?"

### Example Breadth Question

**Question:** You're brought in to an existing project with a three-tier web site: A web server front-end, an application server, and a database. Each is on its own single separate machine. We want to upgrade the database without taking the site down for "scheduled maintenance". How can we do this?

**Competency:** Modern Architecture

-   **Unfamiliar:** Does not understand horizontal scaling, blue-green deployments or how to manage multiple instances. Thinks scheduled maintenance is an unavoidable fact of life.
-   **Familiar:** Suggests using multiple servers, with load balancing in front of them so that one instance of the database is online while the other is being upgraded.
-   **Experienced:** Able to discuss specific technologies for doing load balancing, and should recognize that application servers that maintain a session may need some kind of session persistence in the load balancer to function. Candidates should be able to talk about a caching layer in front of the database to permit database reads even if the database is unavailable.
-   **Master:** Will talk about health checks by the load balancers to identify unhealthy application servers. They should also be able to propose a shared storage layer to hold session information to permit migration of a session between application servers to avoid a poor user experience in the event of an app server outage. Candidates should be able to talk about networking and redundant network interfaces.

**Follow-up Questions:**

-   Before we made changes, the first request from a user took 1 second and subsequent requests took 100 milliseconds. We added a bunch of new application server instances behind a round-robin load balancer, and now many requests take 1 second. What's going on?
-   All of our load balancers do round-robin. What should the health checks in front of the front-end HTTP server test for?

### Example Depth Question

**Question:** 	Imagine you will be attending a chief executive briefing along with a number of senior leaders from your organization. These senior leaders have more experience and tenure in the organization than you have. In addition, they hold a view that is in conflict with yours. You need the chief executive to adopt your view. How would you prepare for this meeting?

**Required Follow Up Questions**  

-   Imagine the meeting does not result in the outcome you had hoped for, what do you do next?
-   Imagine the meeting did result in the outcome you hoped for, but the other senior leaders left the meeting with remaining concerns. Would you take any additional action with those stakeholders?
-   Tell us about a time when you experienced a situation where you needed to convince a chief executive of something despite the other leaders who did not feel the same way. What was the outcome and what would you do differently next time?

**Competency:** Stakeholder Engagement

-   **Unfamiliar:** Thinks of meeting preparation as a siloed activity, doing basic research about the chief executive, bringing in the same materials used to brief anyone on the topic, preparing and planning talking points to further applicant's view. Limited follow up after the meeting. Does not show ability to learn from past to apply lessons to the future. Has never been in charge of being the primary negotiator for a position in this type of situation.
-   **Familiar:** Has effectively negotiated for a position previously and shows experience with setting up a compelling presentation, but fails to show a deeper understanding of listening to and working with diverse stakeholders who may be equally as important in implementation and longevity as the chief executive. Understands how to improve based on past experience but failed to transfer that knowledge to the scenario described.
-   **Experienced:** Strategically plans ahead of a critical decision-making making by performing a cross range of preparation, including finding out the position of the others at the agency ahead of time, and creating a set of materials that would be most effective for this audience. This should include thinking outside the box to present user feedback about what needs to be changed, displaying prototypes of the proposal, and coming prepared to counter known arguments with data-driven evidence.
-   **Master:** Takes the time before the briefing to meet with the other senior leaders who will be in attendance to try to show them the evidence and data behind the conflict, and to see if the leaders' concerns can be mitigated in anyway so that the senior leaders can present a more unified approach to the chief executive. Understands that the concern others have should be considered and taken into account, and ensure those with concerns feel heard and addressed. Has gone through this experience multiple times in a way that achieves the end goal without burning bridges with other critical stakeholders in the agency. Able to think critically about this experience and apply those lessons to future scenarios.
