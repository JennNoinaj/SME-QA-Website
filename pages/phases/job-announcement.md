<p class="usa-intro">
  In this phase you will craft and post a job announcement. The job announcement allows the applicants to know what the job is about.
</p>

<div class="chp-toolkit">
  <h4 class="chp-toolkit__title">Toolkit</h4>
  <ul class="chp-toolkit__list">
    <li class="chp-toolkit__item">
      <a href="https://usajobs.github.io/ATP-Support/job-announcement-playbook/" target="_blank" class="chp-toolit__link">Job announcement playbook</a>
    </li>
  </ul>

## Focus on content

<p>
  Job announcements put too much focus on regulations and other legal content, instead of on what a job seeker needs to know. As a result, the job seeker doesn’t have enough information to make an informed decision and agencies are unable to attract qualified applicants.
</p>
<h4>Why should we fix it?</h4>
<p>
  The job announcement is for the job seeker.  The announcement must tell the job seeker what they need to know and what they need to do.  Well written job announcements, with the right information, will attract better qualified and more informed applicants.
</p>
<h4>Here’s what you can do</h4>
<ul class="chp-nested-list">
  <li>Use plain language – <a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-111publ274/pdf/PLAW-111publ274.pdf" target="_blank">it's the law</a>.
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://usajobs.github.io/ATP-Support/job-announcement-playbook/details/overview#job-title" target="_blank">Write a clear job title</a>.</li>
      <li>Read the <a href="https://usajobs.github.io/ATP-Support/job-announcement-playbook/" target="_blank">job announcement playbook</a>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Speak to the job seeker
    <ul>
      <li>Use pronouns to personalize the content and experience (i.e. use “you”, “your” when speaking to the job seeker).</li>
      <li>Don’t use dehumanizing terms like “incumbent” or “candidate”.</li>
      <li>Read the job announcement as if you’re new to the government – does it make sense?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Only include content that the job seeker needs.
    <ul>
      <li>Take the job seeker’s perspective—what do they need to know about this job?</li>
      <li>Use the job analysis and description to identify the most important information.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Read the <a href="https://usajobs.github.io/ATP-Support/job-announcement-playbook/details" target="_blank">job announcement guidelines</a> to know the type of content that goes in each section of the job announcement</li>
  <li>Read the <a href="https://usajobs.github.io/ATP-Support/job-announcement-playbook/details/fair-and-transparent/" target="_blank">Fair &amp; Transparent section of the playbook</a> to know what legal and regulation content is automatically included in the job announcement. You don’t need to repeat this content anywhere else.</li>
  <li>Organize the content logically
    <ul>
      <li>Place the most important information at the top of each section in the job announcement. For example, place the most important job duties as the first few bullets in the duties section.</li>
      <li>Use bulleted lists to break out separate duties and/or qualifications. If you use the new Duties field, it will automatically add bulleted lists. But, you can always add a bulleted list using html.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Key questions</h4>
<ul class="usajobs-recruitment-joa-playbook-home--plays__questions">
  <li>Does the content make sense when you read it out loud?</li>
  <li>Did you put the right content in the right sections?</li>
  <li>Is any of the content repetitive? Do you repeat the same legal or regulations that are in the Fair &amp; Transparent section?</li>
  <li>What does the job seeker need to know at this stage in the process?</li>
  <li>What does the job seeker want to know and what do they already know?</li>
</ul>
