## Focus on content

<p>
  Job announcements put too much focus on regulations and other legal content, instead of on what a job seeker needs to know. As a result, the job seeker doesn’t have enough information to make an informed decision and agencies are unable to attract qualified applicants.
</p>
<h4>Why should we fix it?</h4>
<p>
  The job announcement is for the job seeker.  The announcement must tell the job seeker what they need to know and what they need to do.  Well written job announcements, with the right information, will attract better qualified and more informed applicants.
</p>
<h4>Here’s what you can do</h4>
<ul class="chp-nested-list">
  <li>Use plain language – <a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-111publ274/pdf/PLAW-111publ274.pdf" target="_blank">it's the law</a>.
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://usajobs.github.io/ATP-Support/job-announcement-playbook/details/overview#job-title" target="_blank">Write a clear job title</a>.</li>
      <li>Read the <a href="https://usajobs.github.io/ATP-Support/job-announcement-playbook/" target="_blank">job announcement playbook</a>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Speak to the job seeker
    <ul>
      <li>Use pronouns to personalize the content and experience (i.e. use “you”, “your” when speaking to the job seeker).</li>
      <li>Don’t use dehumanizing terms like “incumbent” or “candidate”.</li>
      <li>Read the job announcement as if you’re new to the government – does it make sense?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Only include content that the job seeker needs.
    <ul>
      <li>Take the job seeker’s perspective—what do they need to know about this job?</li>
      <li>Use the job analysis and description to identify the most important information.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Read the <a href="https://usajobs.github.io/ATP-Support/job-announcement-playbook/details" target="_blank">job announcement guidelines</a> to know the type of content that goes in each section of the job announcement</li>
  <li>Read the <a href="https://usajobs.github.io/ATP-Support/job-announcement-playbook/details/fair-and-transparent/" target="_blank">Fair &amp; Transparent section of the playbook</a> to know what legal and regulation content is automatically included in the job announcement. You don’t need to repeat this content anywhere else.</li>
  <li>Organize the content logically
    <ul>
      <li>Place the most important information at the top of each section in the job announcement. For example, place the most important job duties as the first few bullets in the duties section.</li>
      <li>Use bulleted lists to break out separate duties and/or qualifications. If you use the new Duties field, it will automatically add bulleted lists. But, you can always add a bulleted list using html.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Key questions</h4>
<ul class="usajobs-recruitment-joa-playbook-home--plays__questions">
  <li>Does the content make sense when you read it out loud?</li>
  <li>Did you put the right content in the right sections?</li>
  <li>Is any of the content repetitive? Do you repeat the same legal or regulations that are in the Fair &amp; Transparent section?</li>
  <li>What does the job seeker need to know at this stage in the process?</li>
  <li>What does the job seeker want to know and what do they already know?</li>
</ul>

## Recruiting For Your Roles

When you have positions ready to be announced, plan where you'll advertise the opportunities to attract the best talent based on your needs.

1.  **Post to free and popular targeted job boards**

If you have access to paid job boards, then absolutely use those resources, but consider also finding popular job boards targeted to the audience you are trying to reach. See "[Popular Technology Job Boards](#popular-technology-job-boards)" for some ideas.

2.  **Answer questions about your job posting via email or phone**

Both USDS and The Lab have tasked a panel of people involved in the hiring action with answering questions over a conference call. Include the time and phone number for the pre-scheduled call in your job announcement, along with an explanation of the types of questions you'll cover. For example:

> To address questions about the application process and requirements, `{YOUR OFFICE}` will offer several optional phone calls during the application period for this position. For details about the timing of those calls and how to participate, see <https://www.eventbrite.com/o/[id]>."

While these calls don't help attract applicants, they improve the applicant experience by narrowing the pool to truly interested applicants who need specific answers to stay in contention. If scheduled calls are too much for your group, simply include a phone number or email address that would be staffed  as long as the job is posted, beginning the day your job opens.

3.  **Personal and professional referrals**

Good old fashioned networking is still extremely effective. Mention positions to your internal networks and ask them to reach out to *their* networks to encourage people to apply.

4.  **Resume mining**

The Agency Talent Portal from USAJOBS allows you to search over a million resumes. To request an account, write to <a href="mailto:recruiter-help@usajobs.gov">recruiter-help@usajobs.gov</a>.
