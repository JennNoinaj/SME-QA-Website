title: Training SMEs to Conduct Interviews
intro: While phone interviews are being scheduled with applicants, facilitate a mandatory two-hour interview training for all SMEs who will conduct the next round of interviews that explains how to conduct structured interviews and assess an applicantâ€™s proficiency with the required competencies based on their responses.
---

Before you schedule training for the first round of interviews, divide the SMEs into two groups based on which round of interviews they will conduct. Consider how many applicants passed resume review, as well as any scheduling conflicts you may be aware of at this time.

### Setting Up Phone Assessment Interview Training

Send calendar invites to all SMEs who will conduct the next round of interviews for your hiring action. SMEs can participate in the phone interview training in person or remotely using a conference bridge line, depending on the means and norms at your agency.

Attach these documents to the calendar invite you send to participating SMEs:
- The <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/toolkit/phone-assessment-interviews/phone-interview-training-agenda/">Phone Interview Training Agenda</a>
- The <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/toolkit/assessment-strategy/phone-interview-template.docx">Interview Template</a>: This is the primary document you'll train to. Add the appropriate questions, competencies, and proficiency levels, adding the words "minimum qualification" next to the required proficiency level in the SME rating section according to the results of the job analysis workshop.

### Preparing Your Training Session

After SMEs have been invited, prepare to conduct the interview training.

- Provide the SMEs with the names of the applicants for that round of interviews. SMEs must inform you of any personal relationships they have with the applicants as they may not interview such applicants. For more information, see <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/toolkit/phone-assessment-interviews/personal-relationships/">Guidance on Personal Relationships with Applicants</a>.
- Finalize the dates during which SMEs will be conducting interviews, along with the approximate number of interviews they will conduct.
- Update the `[Phone Interview Training Presentation Template](toolkit-link)` with your agency-specific information, including both the questions for that interview round and final competencies and proficiencies from your job analysis workshop.
