### Setting Up Phone Assessment Interview Training

Send calendar invites to all SMEs who will conduct the next round of interviews for your hiring action. SMEs can participate in the phone interview training in person or remotely using a conference bridge line, depending on the means and norms at your agency.

To prepare for your training:
- Update the `[Phone Interview Training Presentation Template](toolkit-link)` with your agency-specific information, including both the questions for that interview round and final competencies and proficiencies from your job analysis workshop.  
- Update the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/toolkit/phone-assessment-interviews/phone-interview-training-agenda/">Phone Interview Training Agenda</a> and include it in the calendar invite for the training.
