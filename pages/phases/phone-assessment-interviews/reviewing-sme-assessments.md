title: Reviewing SME Assessments
intro: As SMEs submit their interview assessments, check their work and email them with any necessary feedback.

- Skim for jarring inconsistencies in their competency ratings (for example, feedback that "Applicant answered question poorly", but rated a "Meets" for that competency).
- Verify that each required question documents the applicant's response.
Verify that every core competency has a rating of Does Not Meet, Meets, or Exceeds.
- Verify that the correct competency ratings and applicant responses are documented for the roles the applicant is eligible for (for example, if the applicant interviewed for Generalist and Network, then the SME must provide a competency rating and applicant response for the core competencies and Network).
- Verify that the summary interview analysis is complete (with at least a few sentences).
- Confirm the SME correctly addressed any initial issues you may have reported.

### Conducting a Tiebreaker Discussion with SMEs

When the first two phone interview ratings require a tiebreaker, facilitate a call between the two SMEs who conducted the phone interviews to discuss whether the applicant meets the required competencies to move forward to receive a passing score.

At the end of the call, the SME with the lower score should add a new note for the applicant describing why they now believe the applicant should receive a 3, 4, or 5.
