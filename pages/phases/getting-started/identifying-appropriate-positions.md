Your agency policy should also allow:

- SMEs to determine and document applicant qualifications
- A JOA that informs applicants that SMEs will only review the first 2-3 pages of their resume
- Simplified assessment efforts, such as one SME per interview and a simple competency checklist for reviewing resumes

### Identifying a Classified Position Description

Your position description (PD) should be classified as a GS-12+ technical position that requires specialized experience, such as IT Specialist or Biologist, and should be flexible enough for your posted job opportunity announcement (JOA) to be accurate and compelling. If you can't find a PD that meets your needs, you may need to create a new one in a timely fashion.

For simplicity, we recommend hiring only for one role at a single grade level, in one location.

### Identify Billets

To make this type of hiring action effective, you should have approved headcount of five or more GS-12+ billets for the same technical role. Fewer billets may not provide the necessary return on SME time required for this process.

To make the effort worthwhile, you can share your certificate with another office or agency with vacancies in the same position to share the certificate. This also allows the two groups to share SMEs throughout the action.
