### Identifying a Classified Position Description

Your position description (PD) should reflect adequate specialized experience to require the time and effort of SMEs. Rather than classifying a new PD, using a standardized PD is encouraged since you will be doing an in-depth job analysis workshop to link the PD to an accurate job announcement. The competencies identified through the job analysis workshop simply need to be rooted in the PD. <a href="https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/hiring-information/competitive-hiring/deo_handbook.pdf">Page 3-12 of the updated DE Handbook clarifies</a>:

<blockquote>"Conditions of employment should be supported in the position description and/or by job analysis."</blockquote>


### Identify Billets

To make this type of hiring action effective, you should have approved headcount of five or more GS-12+ billets for the same technical role. Fewer billets may not provide the necessary return on SME time required for this process.

To make the effort worthwhile, you can share your certificate with another office or agency with vacancies in the same position to share the certificate. This also allows the two groups to share SMEs throughout the action.
