intro: In the typical competitive delegated examining hiring process, HR specialists review resumes and occupational questionnaires to determine that applicants are minimally qualified. Hiring managers often know that qualified people have applied for their open role, but receive delegated examining certificates without truly qualified applicants to select. The Competitive Hiring Pilot introduces subject matter experts (SMEs), in partnership with HR specialists as guides, to create and conduct interview assessments before an applicant is considered qualified. HR specialists protect merit principles and ensure that participants the documented assessment strategy is applied consistently.

### Developing a Talent Pipeline Strategy

To get the best people for your technical positions, develop a long-term talent pipeline strategy to tell prospective applicants about your agency and the types of work you typically do.

1.  **Attend technology conferences.**

Both USDS and The Lab at OPM encourage staff to participate in tech events both in the DC area and across the country. In order for this to be successful, both groups do what they can to remove friction so that staff can talk about their government work as freely as possible. USDS uses consistent media outreach, blog posts, and social media activity to help raise their profile, and while this takes time and effort to establish, it has paid off.

2.  **Cultivate relationships with well connected individuals.**

The Lab maintains a list of both designers and people interested in civic tech with large networks and audiences. They routinely reach out to these people when there's a job posting to ask them to mention it on Twitter, their blog, LinkedIn page, or even an email to their network.

3.  **Engage with local professional affinity groups.**

If SMEs are members of local meet-ups or other communities, encourage them to share your job announcement there. For example, see these popular D.C. technology events and communities:

-   [D.C. area Drupal meetup group Slack channel](https://www.meetup.com/drupal-dc/messages/archive/)
-   [D.C. Tech (Rails and JS heavy)](https://www.meetup.com/DC-Tech-Meetup/discussions/)
-   [D.C. Agile Software testing group](https://www.meetup.com/dcast-io/discussions/)
-   [Code for D.C.](https://www.meetup.com/Code-for-DC/discussions/)
-   [Refresh D.C.](https://refresh-dc.org/) - A community of web designers, developers, and other new media professionals working together to refresh the creative, technical, and professional aspects of their trades in the Washington, D.C. area.
