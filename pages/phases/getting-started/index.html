intro: To decide if this process is right for your hiring action, you should first confirm that for typical competitive hire vacancies, qualified applicants apply but are unable to get through to the certificate. That is, hiring managers are not getting access to truly qualified applicants resulting in frequently cancelled certificates.

<h2>Pilot Requirements</h2>
<p>
  If you are considering solving the problem of hiring managers not getting access to truly qualified applicants then your hiring action should meet these requirements:
</p>

<h3>Vacancies</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The vacancy has approved headcount of 5+ billets for the same position. Fewer billets may not provide the necessary return on SME time required for this process.</li>
  <li>A minimum of 5 hires in the next 4 months.</li>
  <li>Technical positions.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Agency support</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Agency policy that allows SMEs to determine applicant qualifications and to use simplified efforts (i.e. 1 SME per interview, competency checklist for resume review vs. writing multiple paragraphs).</li>
  <li>Agency policy that allows the JOA to inform applicants that SMEs will only review the first 2-3 pages of the resume.</li>
  <li>Policies that permit SMEs to determine candidate qualification.</li>
  <li>Willingness by HR to reposition specialized experience as technical competencies in the JOA and to re-write or not use standard OMB competencies.</li>
  <li>Minimized level of effort for SME (light lift resume review, resume page limits, smaller panels of one SME/phone interview)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Staff</h3>
<ul>
  <li>A group of high-quality SMEs (6-10) must be able to dedicate significant time (spread out over 2-3 months) for participating in job assessment, resume review, and interviews.</li>
  <li>HR specialist or project manager who can manage and oversee the process, end-to-end. This requires someone who is detail-oriented and willing and able to work closely with SMEs and schedulers.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Data</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Ability to pull baseline data for recent DE hiring actions to compare numbers of qualified and selected applicants with the results of this process.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Position Description</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The PD must be classified at the proper GS level and flexible enough for the JOA to be accurate and compelling. This may require the ability to create a new PD in a timely fashion. It is also should be a GS12+ technical position that requires specialized experience, such as IT Specialist or paralegal.</li>
  <li>A flexible definition of “rooted in PD” so job announcements are accurate and compelling.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Job announcement</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Allow tailoring of the job announcement to accurately reflect the position (even when using standard PDs) through job analysis.</li>
  <li>Reposition specialized experience as technical competencies that leave room for SME judgement over keywords, which discriminate against shorter resumes.</li>
</ul>

<p>This process has been approved by OPM Policy and piloted with two agencies.</p>


<h2>Checklist</h2>
<p>
  Use this checklist to get started:
</p>
<ul class="chp-checklist">
  <li><strong>Collect baseline data:</strong> Collect data on recent DE hiring actions to see how many applicants were deemed qualified and the number of selections for comparison purposes.</li>
  <li><strong>Identify Positions and Billets:</strong> Confirm you have a classified PD at the proper GS level and that you have multiple vacancies (5+) for the same position/role.</li>
  <li><strong>Select staff:</strong> Select a full time HR specialist and a Project Manager to oversee the process, and establish a process to select your 8 SMEs.</li>
  <li><strong>Select Subject Matter Experts (SMEs):</strong> Use our <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/hiring-phases/getting-started/sme-criteria/">guide to selecting SMEs</a></li>
  <li><strong>Setup job analysis workshop:</strong> Set up your 2-day <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/hiring-phases/job-analysis/">job analysis workshop</a> with HR and a subset of your SMEs where you will define critical competencies, proficiency levels, and write two sets of structured interview questions.</li>
  <li><strong>Finalize your assessment strategy documentation:</strong> Use our <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/templates/assessment-strategy/">assessment strategy template</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Create job announcement</strong>: Craft and <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/hiring-phases/job-announcement/">post the job announcement</a> that reflects the new assessment strategy. Once the JOA closes, you can proceed to SME resume review and structured interviews.</li>
</ul>
