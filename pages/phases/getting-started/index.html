intro: In the typical competitive delegated examining hiring process, HR specialists review resumes and occupational questionnaires to determine that applicants are minimally qualified. Hiring managers often know that qualified people have applied for their open role, but receive delegated examining certificates without truly qualified applicants to select. The Competitive Hiring Pilot introduces subject matter experts (SMEs), in partnership with HR specialists as guides, to create and conduct interview assessments before an applicant is considered qualified. HR specialists protect merit principles and ensure that participants the documented assessment strategy is applied consistently.

<h2>Is this process right for your agency?</h2>

<p>
  In order to utilize this process you must meet the following criteria:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The primary problem faced by the agency is getting truly qualified applicants through to the hiring manager on the certificate.</li>
  <li>Allow tailoring of the job announcement to accurately reflect the position (even when using standard PDs) through job analysis.</li>
  <li>Reposition specialized experience as technical competencies that leave room for SME judgement over keywords, which discriminate against shorter resumes.</li>
  <li>6-8 SMEs are available to participate in job analysis, resume review, and inteviews (time intensive process). The SMEs are setting the required qualifications and writing the interview questions with HR participating/training and accountable for the overall process.</li>
  <li>Minimized level of effort for SME (light lift resume review, resume page limits, smaller panels of one SME/phone interview)</li>
  <li>Vacancy Requirements : 5+ openings for the same position, GS12+ technical role (not just IT)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Checklist</h2>
<p>
  Use this checklist to get started:
</p>
<ul class="chp-checklist">
  <li><strong>Collect baseline data:</strong> Collect data on recent DE hiring actions to see how many applicants were deemed qualified and the number of selections for comparison purposes.</li>
  <li><strong>Identify Positions and Billets:</strong> Confirm you have a classified PD at the proper GS level and that you have multiple vacancies (5+) for the same position/role.</li>
  <li><strong>Select staff:</strong> Select a full time HR specialist and a Project Manager to oversee the process, and establish a process to select your 8 SMEs.</li>
  <li><strong>Select Subject Matter Experts (SMEs):</strong> Use our <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/hiring-phases/getting-started/sme-criteria/">guide to selecting SMEs</a></li>
  <li><strong>Setup job analysis workshop:</strong> Set up your 2-day <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/hiring-phases/job-analysis/">job analysis workshop</a> with HR and a subset of your SMEs where you will define critical competencies, proficiency levels, and write two sets of structured interview questions.</li>
  <li><strong>Finalize your assessment strategy documentation:</strong> Use our <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/templates/assessment-strategy/">assessment strategy template</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Create job announcement</strong>: Craft and <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/hiring-phases/job-announcement/">post the job announcement</a> that reflects the new assessment strategy. Once the JOA closes, you can proceed to SME resume review and structured interviews.</li>
</ul>
