intro: The success of your hiring action depends on the strength of your subject matter experts (SMEs). It's understandable that your most exemplary SMEs have many responsibilities on a daily and weekly basis. However, their time investment now will result in stronger hires and a healthier workforce down the line.

### Choosing SMEs

To assess an estimated 100 applicants, you’ll need around eight SMEs, assuming you’ll assign one SME to conduct each phone interview. To choose SMEs, work with the hiring manager to find the best-suited SMEs to participate in your hiring action. Potential SMEs should complete a background information form and submit a resume as part of the selection process. Document this information in the case file for the hiring action.

Generally, SMEs should be:

- At or above the grade (GS) level for the advertised role.
- An active SME or supervisor, even if they aren't currently performing the duties of that job. They can't be a hiring manager or selecting official for the certificate.
- Readily familiar with the role and required tasks required for the first day on the job, allowing them to evaluate resumes and conduct interviews to gauge proficiency with the competencies.
- Available for at least one entire phase of the hiring action, if not multiple.

Once you choose SMEs, they must sign the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/toolkit/getting-started/sme-confidentiality-agreement.pdf">SME Confidentiality Agreement</a> and agree to protect all testing material, including interview questions and required proficiency levels. They also can’t apply for the position(s) you post for the hiring action.

## Setting Time and Effort Expectations

SMEs will participate throughout your hiring action at various levels, depending on the phase. Use these descriptions of their efforts to set expectations with hiring managers and SMEs you’re considering for participation.

It's critical for you to identify a project manager to manage the deliverables required from each phase of your action, in addition to the hiring manager who will make selections off of your resulting certificate.

- **Job Analysis:** With guidance from HR, SMEs will spend up to 16 hours within a one week period creating the competencies, proficiency levels, and structured interview questions they’ll use during resume review and interview assessments. Ideally, all SMEs conducting the assessments should take part in the job analysis. These exercises work best when all SMEs attend in person.
- **Follow-up:** The week after job analysis, a subset of SMEs who participated in that workshop will spend up to four hours composing the language for the job announcement with HR. They’ll also test and refine the interview questions developed during the job analysis phase.
- **Resume Review Training:** Before SMEs begin reviewing resumes, HR will conduct a mandatory two-hour resume review training, followed by 1 hour of reviewing actual resumes in their list with HR present to answer questions.
- **Resume Review:** HR will divide applicants evenly among groups of two SMEs. They will have four days to review all the resumes in their list. Each resume requires two reviews.
- **Resume Review Tiebreaker:** Over a two-day period, an additional SME will be assigned to each divided list of applicants to break any ties between the first two assessments.
- **Phone Assessment Interview Training:** While phone interviews are being scheduled with applicants, HR will conduct a mandatory two-hour interview training for all SMEs conducting the first and second phone assessment interviews. This training explains how to conduct structured interviews, assess an applicant’s proficiency with the required competencies based on their responses, and develop an overall assessment rating based on the outcome of the resulting proficiencies.
- **Phone Assessment Interviews:** Over a 2-3 week period, SMEs will contribute up to 20 hours per week conducting interviews with applicants. This assumes each interview is one hour long. This includes a recommended 45 minutes after each interview for completing the interview rating sheet and adding their feedback to the talent acquisition system. The time required will vary depending on how many applicants moved forward past the resume review stage and the first phone interview.
