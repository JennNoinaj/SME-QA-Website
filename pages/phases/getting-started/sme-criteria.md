phase: getting-started
intro: When you begin a hiring action, one of your first tasks is to select subject matter experts (SMEs) to participate in job analysis, review applicant resumes, and interview the applicants who move on from resume review. Work with hiring managers to select SMEs who excel in their position and are detail-oriented enough to assess an applicant's qualifications.

## Choosing SMEs

You'll need about 6 SMEs to assess an estimated 100 initial applicants. This estimate assumes you'll assign one SME to conduct each phone interview.

To choose SMEs, conduct an SME selection process established by the Hiring Manager and HR Specialist to ensure that the SMEs are best suited to participate in your hiring action. Generally, SMEs should be:
- At or above the grade (GS) level for the role that's advertized.
- An active SME or supervisor, but not a hiring manager or selecting official for the certificate.
- Readily familiar with the role and required tasks in order to evaluate an applicant's resume to gauge proficiency with the competencies required from Day 1 on the job, even if the SME isn't currently performing the duties of that job.
- Able to dedicate time for at least one entire phase of the hiring action, if not multiple.

Potential SMEs should [complete a background information form](https://federalist-proxy.app.cloud.gov/site/labopm/competitive-hiring-pilot/docs/sme-background-info-sheet.docx) and submit a resume as part of the selection process. Document this information in the case file for the hiring action.

Once you choose SMEs, they must [sign confidentiality agreements](https://federalist-proxy.app.cloud.gov/site/labopm/competitive-hiring-pilot/docs/sme-confidentiality-agreement.pdf) and agree to protect all testing material, including interview questions and required proficiency levels. They also can't apply for the position(s) you post for the hiring action.

## Setting Time and Effort Expectations

SMEs will participate throughout your hiring action at various levels, depending on the phase. Use these descriptions of their efforts to set expectations with hiring managers and SMEs you're considering for participation.

- **Job Analysis:** With guidance from HR, SMEs will spend up to 16 hours within a one week period creating the competencies, proficiency levels, and structured interview questions they'll use during resume review and interview assessments. Ideally, all SMEs conducting the assessments should take part in the job analysis. These exercises work best when all SMEs attend in person.
- **Follow-up:** The following week, a subset of SMEs who participated in job analysis will spend up to four hours composing the language for the job announcement with HR. They'll also test and refine the interview questions developed during the job analysis phase.
- **Resume Review Training:** Before SMEs begin reviewing resumes, HR will conduct a mandatory two-hour resume review training, followed by 1 hour of reviewing actual resumes in their list with HR present to answer questions.
- **Resume Review:** HR will divide applicants evenly among groups of two SMEs. They will have four days to review all the resumes in their list. Each resume requires two reviews.
- **Resume Review Tiebreaker** Over a two-day period, an additional SME will be assigned to each divided list of applicants to break any ties between the first two assessments.
- **First Phone Interview Training** While first phone interviews are being scheduled with applicants who moved on from resume review, HR will conduct a mandatory two-hour interview training for all SMEs conducting the interviews. This training explains how to conduct structured interviews, assess an applicant's proficiency with the required competencies based on their responses, and develop an overall assessment rating based on the outcome of the resulting proficiencies.
- **First Phone Interviews - Breadth of Knowledge** SMEs will contribute up to 20 hours per week for a two week period conducting interviews with applicants who moved on from resume review. This assumes each interview is one hour long. The SMEs should also spend 45 minutes after each interview completing the interview rating sheet and adding their feedback to the talent aquisiton system. The time required will vary depending on how many applicants moved forward past the resume review stage.
- **Second Phone Interview Training** While second phone interviews are being scheduled with applicants who moved on from the first round of phone interviews, HR will conduct a mandatory two-hour interview training for all SMEs conducting the interviews, covering the same content from the first phone interview training.
- **Phone Interviews Round Two - Depth of Knowledge:** SMEs will contribute up to 20 hours per week for a two week period conducting interviews with applicants who moved on from the first round of phone interviews. This assumes each interview is one hour long. The SMEs should also spend 45 minutes after each interview completing the interview rating sheet and adding their feedback to the talent aquisiton system. The time required will vary depending on how many applicants moved forward past the first phone interview.
- **Tie Breaking Discussion:** When the two SMEs who conducted the first and second interviews can't come to a conclusion about whether an applicant should move forward to be considered qualified, they will join a conference call with HR, who will listen and facilitate a final decision for the applicants.
