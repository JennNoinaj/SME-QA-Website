intro: Before you train subject matter experts on how to review resumes, prepare the applications that they'll review, as well as the talent acquisition system (TAS) accounts they'll need. This allows the SMEs to begin reviewing resumes immediately after they're trained.

### General Ineligibility Requirements

Because applicants' qualifications are defined as specialized experience established during job analysis, there is no HR minimum qualification review. Instead, SMEs will check for technical proficiencies and a year of relevant experience during their resume review. There is no education substitution for positions using this hiring process.

Two SMEs will independently review each remaining applicant's resume to determine whether they adequately reflect the core competencies and proficiencies to warrant the first of two phone assessment interviews, with a third SME conducting tiebreaker reviews if necessary.

Mark applicants as ineligible if:
- They do not have a resume.
- They do not meet the citizenship requirement, if not automatically filtered for your agency. Confirm whether this check is necessary and if so, how to correctly apply the filter in your TAS.

### Create TAS Accounts and Create Applicant Lists

Once you have your final list of applicants who will be reviewed, create TAS accounts for each SME who will conduct resume reviews.

Divide applicants evenly among participating SMEs, assigning two SMEs to review each applicant's resume.

1. Export the list of remaining applicants to a spreadsheet.
2. In the spreadsheet, add columns for each available role or parenthetical available under your hiring action, if applicable. If applicants may only apply for a maximum number of roles, ensure that each applicant is considered for only that number.
3. Divide the resume review assignments among the available SMEs. Two SMEs must review each resume. Do not include SMEs who will conduct tiebreaker reviews.

## Set Up and Conduct Resume Review Training

**Short Description:** Before providing SMEs with their resume review assignments, conduct a two-hour training on how to review resumes. Optionally, follow your training with a one-hour guided resume review session, where you'll provide SMEs with their assignments and review resumes as a group.

### Setting Up Resume Review Training

Send calendar invites to all SMEs who will review resumes for your hiring action, including those who will provide tiebreaker reviews.

To prepare for your training:
- Update the resume review training presentation template with your agency-specific information, including the final competencies and proficiencies from your job analysis workshop.
- Prepare your handouts.
- Gather sample resumes from the USAJOBS Agency Talent Portal. To request an account, write to <a href="mailto:recruiter-help@usajobs.gov">recruiter-help@usajobs.gov</a>. You'll need around five resumes that represent both public and private sector resumes for each role you're hiring for.

## Providing SMEs With Assignments

Once participating SMEs have been trained to review resumes, provide them with their assignments.

Give the SMEs a 4-day deadline to complete their review. Depending on the number of SMEs and applicants, SMEs should save 5-10 hours for resume review over the 4-day period.
