intro: When SMEs complete the qualifying assessment interviews, you can adjudicate veterans' preference and assign categories based on whether the applicant met or exceeded the requirements during the interviews. After you issue a hiring certificate to the hiring manager, they can either conduct additional interviews or make selections based on transcripts from the phone assessment interviews.

## HR Preference Adjudication

Veterans' Preference will be applied only to those who meet the overall passing score. Up until that point, any applicant can be removed from consideration if they are determined not to meet the required qualifications (competencies/proficiencies).

## Hiring manager interviews

The primary variable changed by this process is how you assess applicants to determine they meet the basic qualifications before applying rankings and preference. All steps after the certificate can be done the same as the agency currently does. If hiring managers want to have additional interviews with applicants from the certificate they can do so. However, to pass over a veteran, they need to abide by title 5 requirements and submit a pass over request.

Hiring managers may also choose not to conduct additional interviews and instead to rely on the interview transcript notes to determine if they want to make offers to applicants on the certificate.

## Selections

The goal from this process is that there are fewer applicants who make it through qualifications and onto the certificate; but that there are no delegated examining certificates that result in no selections. In fact, ideally many of the applicants on the certificate can be made offers for positions at the agency (or at other agencies through a shared certificate) considering the extraordinary SME review process that took place to qualify these applicants.
