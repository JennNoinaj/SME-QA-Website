intro: When SMEs complete the qualifying assessment interviews, you can adjudicate veterans' preference and assign categories based on whether the applicant met or exceeded the requirements during the interviews. After you issue a hiring certificate to the hiring manager, they can either conduct additional interviews or make selections based on transcripts from the phone assessment interviews.

## Adjudicating Preference

Apply Veterans' preference only to applicants who achieve an overall passing score. Up until that point, any applicant can be removed from consideration if they are determined not to qualify based on the required competencies and proficiencies.

OPM's MSAC ACE will review the final category assignments to ensure they're lawful. HR will then issue the certificate of eligibles of the "Best Qualified" category to the HM.

## Post-Certificate Interviews

After the hiring certificate is issued, agencies can use the same procedures they always have. Hiring managers may conduct additional interviews with applicants from the certificate, or choose instead to rely on the interview transcript notes to determine whether they'll make offers to applicants on the certificate.

To pass over a veteran, hiring managers must meet the requirements of 5 U.S.C. ยง 3318 and submit a pass over request. For more information, see the "[Vet Guide for HR Professionals](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/veterans-services/vet-guide-for-hr-professionals/)" on the *OPM Website*.

## Selecting Qualified Applicants from a Certificate

When hiring with this process, there should be fewer applicants who make it through qualifications and onto the certificate, with more selections off of the delegated examining certificates. Ideally, the extraordinary SME review process that qualifies applicants will allow applicants on the certificate to receive offers for positions at an agency. If there are more qualified applicants on a certificate than available billets at an agency, that agency may choose to share the certificate with other groups or agencies.
