### Example Breadth Question

**Question:** You're brought in to an existing project with a three-tier web site: A web server front-end, an application server, and a database. Each is on its own single separate machine. We want to upgrade the database without taking the site down for "scheduled maintenance." How can we do this?

**Follow-up Questions:**

- How does this affect the application server?
- What happens next?

### Example Depth Question

**Question:** Imagine you will be attending a chief executive briefing along with a number of senior leaders from your organization. These senior leaders have more experience and tenure in the organization than you have. In addition, they hold a view that is in conflict with yours. You need the chief executive to adopt your view. How would you prepare for this meeting?

**Required Follow Up Questions**

- Imagine the meeting does not result in the outcome you had hoped for, what do you do next?
- Imagine the meeting did result in the outcome you hoped for, but the other senior leaders left the meeting with remaining concerns. Would you take any additional action with those stakeholders?
- Tell us about a time when you experienced a situation where you needed to convince a chief executive of something despite the other leaders who did not feel the same way. What was the outcome and what would you do differently next time?
