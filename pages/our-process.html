          In the current competitive hire process, agencies utilize HR resume review and occupational questionnaires to determine if a candidate is "minimally qualified", and applicants who pass this step are automatically "qualified" for categorization and preference application. The Competitive Hiring Pilot instead deploys the resume review step as a <strong>pre-qualification</strong> for an overall passing score assessment.
        </p>
        <h4>How our process is different</h4>
        <p>
          Applicants who receive a passing score after multiple professionally developed SME assessments are rated and placed on the certificate of eligibles (following current veterans' preference and category rating rules) by HR. While OPM encourages IO
          Psychologists to professionally develop assessments, this pilot will have SMEs, HR, and the Hiring Manager coming together to professionally develop the competencies, proficiency levels, and structured interview questions that will define the
          assessments. If the agency has available IO Psychologists, they should be encouraged to participate.

        <h4>Current process</h4>
        <p>
          OPM's Qualification Standards are used to define the minimum qualifications for the job. Specialized Experience describes requirements needed for day one on the job. These are often described as tasks that someone needed to have experience
          doing, and tend to be very specific.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="tablet:grid-col padding-y-2">
        <h4>Pilot process</h4>
        <p>
          Specialized experience will be listed as technical competencies that are needed to do the job from day one and augment the qualifications described from OPM. The job announcement has all competencies listed together as part of the minimum
          qualifications to perform the job.

      <div class="tablet:grid-col padding-y-2">
        <h4>Current process</h4>
        <p>
          HR reviews resumes to determine if the applicants' stated qualifications and specialized experience are demonstrated. Applicants who pass this review are "minimally qualified".
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="tablet:grid-col padding-y-2">
        <h4>Pilot process</h4>
        <p>
          As a pre-qualifying step for applicants to move to assessment ratings, HR reviews all resumes to remove applicants whose applications are incomplete, who are ineligible for federal employment or clearly unqualified for the position, such as
          a product management role where no evidence was provided of skills related to that role. For remaining applicants, SMEs review the resumes to determine if technical competencies warrant further assessments.

        <h4>Current process</h4>
        <p>
          Anyone who remains eligible in the resume review step above (e.g., those meeting minimum qualifications) moves on to the assessment to determine quality category placement. The most common approach is to use a self-rated occupational
          questionnaire.

        <h4>Pilot process</h4>
        <p>
          Pre-qualified applicants go through a <strong>breadth</strong> interview with SMEs. If they earn an assessment rating of 3/4/5, then they go through a <strong>depth</strong> interview with SMEs to receive an additional assessment rating. The
          breadth and depth assessment ratings are combined to create an <strong>overall passing score</strong> where passing requires (a transmuted score) of &gt;=70.
        </p>
        <p>Applicants who receive a 1 or 2 assessment rating in the initial breadth interview do not move forward and are screened out because they would be unable to achieve the required <strong>overall</strong> passing score of &gt;=70. Similarly,
          applicants who receive a 1 or 2 in the depth interview would be screened out because of their inability to achieve an overall score of &gt;=70.</p>
        <p>Applicants who do both interviews but who do not receive an <strong>overall</strong> passing score of &gt;=70 (e.g., two 3's) will also be screened out.</p>
        <p>Veterans’ preference will be applied only to those who meet the overall passing score.</p>
