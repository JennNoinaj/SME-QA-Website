title: Preference Adjudication Rating Guide

For applicants who proceed through both assessment interviews, transmute the interview assessment ratings into a final overall passing score to determine the category where they should be placed (before preferences are applied).

**NOTE:** Applicants who do not receive a combination of 1s and 2s are not placed in a category as they did not achieve an overall passing score.
