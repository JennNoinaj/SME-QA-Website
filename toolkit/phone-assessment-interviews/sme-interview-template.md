**Provide Assessment Rating (1-5) if you evaluated applicant for:)**

Generalist: ____ (rated for first five CORE ONLY)

Parenthetical/Role 1 : ____ (rated for CORE + Par 1)

Parenthetical/Role 2: ____ (rated for CORE + Par 2)

Parenthetical/Role 3: ____ (rated for CORE + Par 3)

*Evaluate up to two above (as notated by HR for each applicant)

**Assessment Rating Justification:**

**In addition to your summary, any competencies not specifically covered by an interview question need to be explained within the justification. For example, if you assessed technical communication overall throughout the interview rather than asking a specific question about technical communication, note that here.**
