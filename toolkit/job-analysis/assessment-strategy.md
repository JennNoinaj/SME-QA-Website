## Multiple-Hurdle Assessment Process

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/multi-hurdle-process-v3.4.png" alt="Our multi-hurdle process diagram">

### Job Analysis

Based on job tasks performed in these positions at [agency] SMEs, HR, and Hiring Managers will come together to professionally develop the competencies, proficiency levels, and structured interview questions that will define the assessments. SMEs will use this package to conduct technical evaluation during the process.

See "Developing Core Competencies" (Appendix) for details on creating the job analysis package.

### [Customize this section if the job posting is for multiple parentheticals]

[Agency] will hire for [specific job grade] positions across multiple parentheticals. They will share SMEs across the parentheticals to determine which core competencies are required for all positions. In addition, the SMEs for each parenthetical will develop one additional competency, required proficiency level, and interview questions (one each for breadth and depth interviews) required for that parenthetical.

All SMEs will assess all competencies in the resume review step and breadth interview. However, only the SME for a specific parenthetical will conduct the depth interview for applicants who choose that parenthetical. If the applicant chooses more than one parenthetical, multiple SMEs (one from each parenthetical) may be required for the depth interview.

### Job Announcement

The Job Announcement (JOA) will inform applicants that only the first two pages of their resume will be reviewed. However, SMEs can use the first two pages of work experience should work experience not be listed until page two based on the use of USAJobs Resume Builder technology or another formatting issue.

**(Customize this content if the job announcement is for multiple parentheticals)**

During the application process, applicants will choose from a list of four parentheticals (including IT Generalist). They will be told to choose no more than two, but if they choose more, they will only be considered for the first two selected (in the order listed on the USA Jobs posting). Applicants will then only be evaluated for up to two parentheticals, and thus can only be deemed qualified for up to two parentheticals.

**(Customize this content if the job announcement will be pulled early for any reason)**

This DE job announcement will close on midnight the day the number of applicants reaches 100, thus total applicants may exceed 100.

### Pre-Qualification Resume Review

HR will review all resumes to remove applicants whose applications are ineligible for federal employment due to U.S. citizenship and requirements.

For remaining applicants, their resumes will be reviewed by two to three SMEs. Two SMEs will each give a rating of **Move Forward**, **Does Not Move Forward**, or **Borderline**. A third SME may be needed to break a tie between the first two SME assessments. The appendix includes documents explaining the process by which applicants either move forward to passing score assessments or are screened out.

**See Appendix for resume review instructions ("Reviewing Resumes") and the Rating Guide.**

### HR Resume Review

When the SME resume review is complete, HR will not be conducting a separate qualifications review to validate the SME decision. HR will ensure SMEs have provided necessary justification within their note in USA Staffing, as per the Resume Review Instructions document and SME resume review training.  If any documentation is lacking, HR will work to ensure SMEs complete their notes.

After resume review, HR may choose to conduct quick phone calls with each applicant who has moved forward to the next stage. The purpose of this call is to ensure the applicant is aware of key job details including location, salary, and background check.

### Passing Score Assessments

**See Appendix for Understanding the OPM Pilot Process and how to use the Rating Guide.**

The passing score assessments examine which applicants meet the competencies and proficiency levels to determine who is qualified.

As explained in "Understanding the OPM Pilot Process," the agency's SMEs will conduct the assessment hurdles and select which applicants do not move forward based on professionally developed assessments. Anyone an SME determines is unqualified based on the pre-determined technical competencies will not be added back after each round. Instead, HR will adjudicate and apply Veterans’ preference only to applicants who achieve the overall passing score after the second interview.

During each phone interview, one SME will assess the competencies and proficiency levels defined during job analysis. The SME will write thorough notes about the applicant’s answers in the structured interview question guide. In addition, [agency] will include HR in the interviews to ensure the SME complies with the structured interview process and asks only the structured list of questions developed during job analysis.

In the event of a tie, the SMEs from the breadth and depth interviews will meet with HR over the phone to discuss if the applicant met the competencies and proficiencies and decide whether the applicant should move forward. After the discussion, the SME who gave a 3 must add a new note in USA Staffing explaining their final determination, including details of the competency they were previously unable to assess. For example, if the two SMEs had given a 3 and 5, and they decided after conversation to give an overall score of 4, they should document that outcome and justification.

The SME assessing the applicant will provide an assessment rating based on the competencies and proficiency levels in the Rating Guide provided in the Appendix.

### HR Interview Assessment Review

After each interview round (including tiebreaker), HR will review each SME's "Note" for the interview summary decision to ensure the SME provided the necessary justification.  If any documentation is lacking, HR will work to ensure SMEs complete their notes.

### Certificate

When the list of applicants who have achieved an overall passing score is complete, HR will assign those applicants to a quality category using SME interview assessment scores and apply veterans’ preference. HR will issue multiple certificates to the relevant hiring manager for each parenthetical for further interviews. Only applicants who chose that parenthetical will be included on that certificate.
