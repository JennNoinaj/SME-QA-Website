title: Creating a List of Applicants for Tiebreaker Resume Reviews
description: How to indicate when a tiebreaker is needed
---

After you review the first round of resume reviews from SMEs, the third SME in the group will complete reviews of applicants who received an "Undecided" score.

<ol>
  <li>To add the tiebreaker, add the third SME to the stored list.</li>
  <li>In the Instructions field, paste these instructions:
  <div class="chp-quote">
    <p>
      The hiring manager for the ____ role needs your help to break some ties in the resume screening process. Please review the applicants with highlighted flags at the end of their row. As the tie breaker, you must give a score of “Pass” or “Does Not Pass.” You have two days to complete these reviews.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Disregard the rating “view” link.</li>
      <li>Within each applicant's row, click the *Notes* bubble and enter a score of `Pass` or `Does not pass`. Include a strong sentence explaining why you are or are not passing the applicant, basing your assessment on the required competencies and proficiency levels.</li>
      <li>Leave the flag at the end of the row selected.</li>
      <li>Click the checkmark at the end of the row to indicate your review is complete for that applicant.</li>
      <li>When you complete your assessments for all applicants, at the bottom of the page, change your status to “Complete.”</li>
    </ol>
  </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    For oversight of the checks and flags, add yourself and your provided USDS contacts to the stored list.
  </li>
  <li>
