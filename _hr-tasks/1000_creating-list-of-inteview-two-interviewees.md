  <li>In USA Staffing, create and save a third stored list called `Interview 2.` This list must be filtered for only eligible applicants.</li>
  <li>Create a review for the stored list with a due date of five business days from today.</li>
  <li>In the Instructions field, paste these instructions:
    <div class="chp-quote">
      <p>

      <ul>
        <li>You should have received an email confirmation regarding each confirmed interview you'll be conducting.</li>
