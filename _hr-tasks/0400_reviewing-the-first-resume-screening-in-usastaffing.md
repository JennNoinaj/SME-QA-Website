title: Reviewing the First Resume Screening in USA Staffing
description: How to ensure that the SMEs have entered scores into USA Staffing correctly.
---

Because the resume review process can be prone to error for SMEs who are less familiar with USA Staffing, it's important to check the stored list they returned to you after their first round of reviews.

1. For each applicant, confirm that the SMEs have provided a note with a score and score description. Email the SMEs to correct information if:

- Only one SME provided a score
- The SME did not provide at least a strong one-sentence score justification referring to the competencies.

2. Confirm that each applicant row has either a check or a flag.

- If the flag was selected but no "Undecided" score was provided, de-select the flag and select the checkmark instead.
- If the flag was not selected but an "Undecided" score was provided, de-select the checkmark and select the flag.
