Check the assessments given by SMEs during their second round of interviews in USA Staffing.

1. For each applicant, confirm that the SMEs have provided a note with a score and score description. Email the SME to correct information if:
  - There is no score.
  - The SME did not provide at least a one-sentence score description referring to the competencies.
2. Confirm that each applicant row has either a check or a flag.
  - If the flag was selected but no 3 score was provided, de-select the flag and select the checkmark instead.
  - If the flag was not selected but a 3 score and a 4 or 5 was provided, de-select the checkmark and select the flag.
3. For each applicant, confirm that the SME has uploaded a completed scoring template, including the transcript, in the Documents tab. The document should be included in the case documents, *not* the applicant documents. Email the SME to upload any missing templates.
4. Within the SME's view of the list, confirm each applicantâ€™s notes:
  - For notes with one score of 3 and another score of 4 or 5, the applicant's status is still "Qualified", but will need a tiebreaker review from a third SME. Make sure the the flag icon is marked for these applicants.
