title: Creating a List of Applicants for Resume Screening
description: How to create an initial list of applicants for SME review.
---

Send all remaining resumes to SMEs for a full review against the competencies listed in the job announcement. SMEs are responsible for deciding whether an applicant's experience meets the minimum qualification for the job.

<ol>
  <li>In USA Staffing, create a review for the stored list you generated from the filtered list of applicants. Set a due date of two days from today.</li>
  <li>
  In the Instructions field, copy and paste these instructions:
  <div class="chp-quote">
    <p>
      Review all applicant resumes in this list. Each applicant requires two reviews in order to be deemed eligible or ineligible.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Disregard the rating “view” link.</li>
      <li>Within each applicant's row, click the <strong>Notes</strong> bubble and enter a score of `Pass`, `Undecided`, or `Does not pass`. Include a strong sentence explaining why you are or are not passing the applicant, basing your assessment on the required competencies and proficiency levels.</li>
      <li>If you're the second reviewer of the applicant and you've completed your review:
        <ul>
          <li>If neither score for the applicant is a 3, click the checkmark at the end of the row to indicate the two required reviews are completed.</li>
          <li>If one of the two scores for the applicant is a 3, click the flag to indicate to your HR specialist that a third SME is needed.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        When you complete your assessments for all applicants, at the bottom of the page, change your status to “Complete.”
      </li>
    </ol>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>Add two SMEs to view the stored list.</li>
  <li>For oversight of the checks and flags, add yourself and your provided USDS contacts to the stored list.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Send Review</strong>.</li>
</ol>
