title: Reviewing Resumes to Remove Ineligible Candidates
description: How to perform an initial pass on applicants.
---

To begin the hiring process, remove applicants who are clearly ineligible for the position because:

-   They do not meet the citizenship requirement.
-   They have zero experience needed for the position, such as a veterinarian applying to be an attorney. This criterion screens out people who may have applied to the wrong job, or who have serially applied to jobs without understanding whether their
    experience matches the listed competencies.
-   Their resume is incoherent.

**_Do not_ assign minimum qualification points to the candidate during this phase.**

1.  In USA Staffing, create and save a stored list called `Resume Review`.
2.  Filter out any ineligible applicants.
3.  From the remaining applicants, generate a stored list.
