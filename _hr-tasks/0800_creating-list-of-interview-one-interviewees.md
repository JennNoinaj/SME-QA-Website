  <li>In the Instructions field, paste these instructions:
    <div class="chp-quote">
      <p>
        You've been assigned phone interviews with 1/3 of the remaining applicants. You have 5 days to complete your interviews.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>You should have received an email confirmation regarding each confirmed interview you'll be conducting.</li>
