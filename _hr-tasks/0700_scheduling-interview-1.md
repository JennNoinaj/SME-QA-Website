Using either a manual scheduling process or an online calendar service, schedule the first round of interviews with the applicants who passed the resume review process.

### Manually Scheduling Interview 1

1. Divide the remaining applicants evenly among the SMEs available for the first interview round. These should be the same group of SMEs who participated in resume review. There is only one SME per phone interview.
2. Assuming 1 hour per interview, ask each SME to send you a list of the hours they have blocked on their calendars for interview week.
3. Reach out to applicants to ask them to select a time slot within two days.  HR can then set up calendar invitations between the SME and the applicant.

### Scheduling Interview 1 Using an Online Calendar Service

1. Divide the remaining applicants evenly among the SMEs available for the first interview round. There is only one SME per phone interview.
2. Inform each Interview 1 SME of how many one hour time slots they need to be available for that week. Ask them to enter the hours directly into the calendar application.
3. In the USA Staffing email that you send to applicants notifying them that they are in the next round, include the calendar URL and instructions stating they have two days to choose a time slot for a phone interview based on the availability in the link.
4. When an applicant books a time slot, the SME attached to that slot will receive an email confirmation that includes the applicant's name.
5. In the stored list in USA Staffing, use the “Notes” bubble to tell the SMEs the applicant to whom they are assigned. Include the date, time, and phone number where the SME should call the applicant.
