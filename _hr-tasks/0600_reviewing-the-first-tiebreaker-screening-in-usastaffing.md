Check the stored list the tiebreaker SME completed after their final round of resume reviews.

1. Confirm that all flagged applicants now have checks, indicating that the tiebreaker SME reviewed their resume. If any applicants were missed, email the tiebreaking SME to complete the reviews.
2. For each applicant, confirm that the SMEs have provided a note with a score and score description. Email the tiebreaker SME to correct information if:
  - There is no score.
  - The SME did not provide at least a one-sentence score justification referring to the competencies.
3. “Recall” the review. At this point, all checks and flags have been cleared, and you can now use the checks to keep track of your note reviews for the next step.
4. Confirm each applicant’s notes:
  - If two separate notes say “Does not Pass,” change the “Min Quals” code from “PA” to “IQID”. Click “Override applicant score.”
  - If two separate notes say "Pass," you do not need to take any action as the applicant's status is still "Qualified".
5. DO NOT give the applicant any numerical score at this point. The SME resume review process does not result in qualification points, but rather qualifies applicants for entry into the passing score assessment process.
