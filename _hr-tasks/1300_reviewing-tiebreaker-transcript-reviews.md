title: Reviewing Tiebreaker Transcript Reviews in USA Staffing
description: How to review the stored list returned to you by the tiebreaker SME.
---

Check the stored list the tiebreaker SME returned to you after their final round of interview transcript reviews.

1. Confirm that all flagged applicants now have checks, indicating that the tiebreaker SME reviewed the transcripts. If any applicants were missed, email the SME to complete the reviews.
2. For each applicant, confirm that the SMEs have provided a note with a score and score description. Email the tiebreaker SME to correct information if:
  - There is no score.
  - The SME did not provide a strong paragraph justifying the score that relates to the competencies.
3. “Recall” the review.
4. Within the HR view of the list, if two separate notes have scores of 1 or 2, or two 3s, change the “Min Quals” code from “PA” to “IQID”. Click “Override applicant score.”
5. At this point, all remaining applicants are considered qualified. Add rating scores based on the scores from the passing score interview assessments. The Min Quals rating for all applicants should be "ELRV".
  - Any applicant with two 4s should get 70 points.
  - Any applicant with one 4 and one 5 should get 85 points.
  - Any applicant with two 5s should get 100 points.
6. You can now adjudicate preference and other eligibility, then issue certificates.
