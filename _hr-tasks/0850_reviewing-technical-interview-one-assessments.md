title: Reviewing the Technical Interview 1 Assessments in USA Staffing
description: How to check the assessments given by SMEs during their first round of interviews in USA Staffing.

Check the assessments given by SMEs during their first round of interviews in USA Staffing.

1. Confirm that all applicants have checkmarks, indicating that the SMEs completed the interviews. If any applicants were missed, email the assigned SME to complete the reviews.
2. For each applicant, confirm that the SMEs have provided a note with a score and score description. Email the SME to correct information if:
  - There is no score.
  - The SME did not provide a strong overall assessment paragraph referring to the competencies.
3. For each applicant, confirm that the SME has uploaded a completed template in the Documents tab. The document should be included in the case documents, *not* the applicant documents. Email the SME to upload any missing templates.
3. “Recall” the review. At this point, all checkmarks have been cleared, and you can now use them to keep track of your note reviews for the next step.
4. Confirm each applicant’s notes:
  - For notes with a score of 1 or 2, change the “Min Quals” code from “PA” to “IQID”. Click “Override applicant score.”
  - For notes with a score of 3, 4, or 5, you do not need to take any action as the applicant's status is still "Qualified".
