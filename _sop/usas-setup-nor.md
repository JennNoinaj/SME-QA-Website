* ELSN - IN: Based on the results of your interviews, subject matter experts have determined that you meet the qualifications for this position. However, you were not in the highest qualification category, or there are other applicants who, by law, must be considered before your application, such as displaced federal employees and certain veterans. Therefore, your application will not be referred to the selecting official at this time. If additional candidates are needed, your application may be referred at a later date.
* ELSR - PA: Based on the results of your interviews, subject matter experts have determined that you meet the qualifications for this position. You have been referred to the hiring manager for selection consideration and may be contacted for additional interviews.
