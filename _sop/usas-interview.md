# USA Staffing Interview Process

## Setup:

1. Ensure that the `SME Resume Reviews` file was imported and that all applicants have had their resume reviewed.
2. Export the applicant list from a saved list filtered only for `PA Applicants` (this is nearly identical to that for the resume review process). This will generate a `csv` file with all of your applicants and the combination of roles and GS levels they applied for.
  - When exporting: only have the `Interview 1` assessment selected
  - Save this file as `SME Interviews 1`

## Interview 1

### Scheduling Interview 1 - No Software

Using a team of schedulers or admins who can coordinate SME schedules and applicant availabilities, schedule the first round of interviews with the applicants who moved forward from resume review. If there are multiple schedulers, they will need to set up a shared scheduling email inbox where all emails between schedulers and applicants can be managed. There are sample resources for the schedulers available in the Interview toolkit.

Instructions for the Schedulers:

1. Determine the daily interview hours that SMEs are available. To do this, email the SMEs conducting the first interview asking for the two time slots they can hold daily for the 2-3 week interview period, along with any days they will be unavailable during the time period. Also, ask for two backup time slots per day to allow for scheduling flexibility based on applicants' interview requests.
2. Email the SMEs the complete list of applicant names moving to the interview round and ask for them to respond if they have a personal relationship with any of the applicants. Do not schedule an SME to interview an applicant they have a personal relationship with.
3. If an HR Specialist will attend each applicant phone interview with an SME (this is NOT recommended), find out how many HR specialists are available to know how many interview slots can overlap during the same time slot.
4. HR will send a list of applicant names, emails, phone numbers, and the roles the applicants are being considered for (if applicable) to the schedulers. Applicants may have applied to several roles in the application process but may have only moved forward to interview for one of these roles.
5. HR will circulate a PDF of all applicant resumes to SMEs for this phase. Make sure all the SMEs have this resume batch prior to starting their first interview.
6. Send an email to all applicants participating in Interview 1 asking them to respond with their top three preferences in the next 2 days. For example:
    ```
    Dear Applicant,

    Thank you for your interest in the {add title from job announcement} position. You have moved forward from resume review. You're now invited to a phone interview with a subject matter expert to further assess your qualifications. This interview will last 30-60 minutes. If you move forward from this interview, you will have one additional subject matter expert qualifications interview. If you're referred for selection, you may be asked to participate in additional interviews with hiring managers.

    Here are some key details about the position you've applied for:
    - Your job location would be in {CITY NAME}. There are no reimbursements for relocation expenses.
    - This is a {GS LEVEL} role. With {CITY NAME} locality pay, the salary ranges from {SALARY LOW} to {SALARY HIGH} per year.
    - While this position does not require a security clearance, you will undergo a background check.

    If you're still interested in this position, reply to this email within two (2) business days with three (3) available blocks of time (from {AM TIME} to {PM TIME} {TIME ZONE}) you're available between {START DATE} and {END DATE} for a phone interview. If we don't receive your availability by {DATE}, we'll assume you are no longer interested and remove you from consideration.

    Thank you for your time,

    Interview Schedulers
    ```
7. When matching applicants to SMEs:
  - Keep track of how many interviews each SME is assigned so that the distribution is relatively even.
  - Schedule at least one SME per phone interview.
  - If deemed necessary by HR, include an HR person in each interview to ensure interviews do not violate prohibited practices.
8. As schedulers receive replies from applicants, schedulers should send a confirmation email and calendar invites to SMEs, applicants (and HR if applicable), matching up applicants to available SME time slots. Schedulers must avoid scheduling an SME with an applicant they provided as a potential bias (e.g if SME Sam has a personal relationship with Applicant Amy, Sam should not be scheduled with Amy). In the email to applicants, include the dial-in information (or applicant phone number, if SME will call them directly), the name of the applicant, and the role(s) they're interviewing for. **Schedulers should not schedule an SME for back-to-back time slots; they need time to complete the interview template after each interview.** Schedulers should not schedule interviews within 24 business hours of the interview to give the applicant and SME time to confirm.
9. Keep track of which applicants have responded to the interview request and which have already been scheduled with which SME. After a reasonable number of days, schedulers should email applicants that haven't responded, informing them of the interview request email and giving them a final chance to respond.

### Reviewing the Phone Interview 1 Assessments

As SMEs complete their interview templates, they will email the completed templates to HR.

1. As you receive completed interview templates from SMEs, save them locally to your computer with the proper naming convention (if not already correct as provided by SME): `ApplicantNameInterviewNumber` (i.e. `JaneDoeInterview1`).
2. Complete an initial check of each SME's first completed template to ensure they're completing them correctly, and email them with any necessary feedback:
  * Skim for jarring inconsistencies in their competency ratings (for example, feedback that "Applicant answered question poorly", but rated a "Meets" for that competency).
  * Verify that each required question documents the applicant's response.
  * Verify that every core competency has a rating of *Does Not Meet*, *Meets*, or *Exceeds*.
  * Verify that the correct competency ratings and applicant responses are documented for the roles the applicant is eligible for (for example, if the applicant interviewed for Generalist and Network, then the SME must provide a competency rating and applicant response for the core competencies and Network).
  * Verify that the summary interview analysis is complete (with at least a few sentences).
3. Complete a check of the remaining interview templates from SMEs (after your initial check), and send back templates with these issues:
  * Confirm the SME correctly addressed any initial issues you reported.
  * Verify that each required question documents the applicant's response.
  * Verify that every core competency has a rating of *Does Not Meet*, *Meets*, or *Exceeds*.
  * Verify that the correct competency ratings and applicant responses are documented for the roles the applicant is eligible for (for example, if the applicant interviewed for Generalist and Network, then the SME must provide a competency rating and applicant response for the core competencies and Network).
  * Verify that the summary interview analysis is complete (with at least a few sentences).
4. On the last page of the template, in the HR section, transcribe the SME's competency ratings into the table and apply the score based on the ratings (0, 1, 2). Repeat for all eligible roles.
  * Applicants who receive a "Does Not Meet" rating for *any core competency* will receive a 0 for all roles.
  * `{APPLIES TO HIGHLY QUALIFIED CONTINGENCY ONLY}` For a "Generalist" role, applicants who receive a "Meets" for all core competencies, including any role-specific competencies, **AND** an "Exceeds" for the `{COMPETENCY NAME}` competency will receive a 2.
5. After each interview is completed, you can update the `SME Interviews 1` file with the ratings from the first interview.
  - For any scores of 0, do not put a score in the `Assessment Rating` column, but only put `IQSM` in the `Minimum Qualifications Rating` column
  - For all other scores, do not put any value in the `Minimum Qualifications Rating`, but put 1 or 2 in the `Assessment Rating` column
6. Upload all completed templates to your staffing system.
7. For any applicants that did not schedule interviews, place the appropriate NOR code in the `Minimum Qualifications Rating` column

### Importing Interview 1 Results

1. Ensure that your `SME Interviews 1` file is complete:
  - Every applicant has either a NOR code in the `Minimum Qualifications Rating` or a value of 1 or 2 in the `Assessment Rating` column
  - No applicant has values in both
  - No applicant has an `Assessment Rating` of `0`
  - No other cells have been edited
  - File type is `csv`
2. Import the file per the `Import to USA Staffing` section
2. Send out NOR letters to notify applicants who are moving forward to the interview assessment or not based on resume review. Sample NOR letters are available in the Resume Review toolkit.

## Interview 2

### Setup

1. Ensure that the `SME Interviews 1` file was imported and that applicants have been updated
2. Export the applicant list from the saved list `PA Applicants`. This will generate a `csv` file with all of your applicants and the combination of roles and GS levels they applied for.
  - When exporting: only have the `Interview 2` assessment selected
  - Save this file as `SME Interviews 2`

### Scheduling Phone Interview 2 with Remaining Applicants - No Software

Using a team of schedulers or admins who can coordinate SME schedules and applicant availabilities, schedule the second round of interviews with the applicants who moved on from the first round using the same instructions as above. If you are having second interviews start as soon as applicants move forward from their first interview, HR should alert schedulers with results immediately so they can schedule a second interview.

Using the updated spreadsheet from round 1, schedulers should only contact applicants who received a 1 or 2 for one or more roles. In addition, applicants should only be matched up with SMEs who are able to assess a particular role. That is, if a "Patch Management" SME cannot assess a "Data Management" interview, then do not use that SME for Data interviews.

Finally, if an applicant moves forward for two distinct roles (e.g. Patch and Data), and this requires two different SMEs, then schedulers must match up applicant availability with both SMEs, who will both need to attend and assess the interview. The SMEs should work out ahead of time who will conduct the interview. The secondary SME is there purely to assess the additional role's competency. This situation will rarely happen.
