description: How to perform the second round of interviewing.
---

Two SMEs will complete the second round of interviews for the applicants who passed the first round of interviews with enough points to ultimately achieve a passing score.

1. You should have received an automated email from usastaffingoffice@opm.gov with the subject line “Review XXX is pending.” Click the link in the email to http://usastaffing.gov and sign in.
2. Select the list of applicants and click "Review Lists".
3. In the applicant list, find the name of the applicant you're interviewing.
4. Save a copy of the provided interview scoring template.
5. Call the provided number for the applicant at the scheduled time. Use the structured interview script for your phone interview, and transcribe everything the applicant says during the phone call. The transcript can include factual notes about the behavior of the applicant, but should not include personal commentary.
6. When the interview is completed, assess whether the applicant meets the required proficiency levels for the competencies needed for this position to be considered "qualified." Write the [score](../../rating-guide/interview-score-table/) in the scoring template along with a paragraph documenting the reason for the score. Any competencies not specifically covered by an interview question need to be explained within the summary text field.  
7. In USA Staffing, paste your overall score and summary notes into the "Notes" bubble. Do not change the Min Qual Rating code or assign points (70-100) through the links on the screen.
8. Upload your interview template document to the black Documents tab.
9. Mark the applicant's row in USA Staffing with a checkmark or flag based on if a tiebreaker is needed.
9. When all interviews are finished, change your status at the bottom of the page to “Complete”.
10. Email your HR specialist to let them know your interviews are finished.
