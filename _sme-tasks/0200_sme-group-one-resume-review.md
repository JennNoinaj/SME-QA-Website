title: SME Group One - Reviewing Resumes
description: How to conduct a resume review if you are in SME Group One
---

Two SMEs from Group One will provide the first two resume reviews for all applicants in USA Jobs, providing a score of “Pass,” “Undecided,” or “Does Not Pass.” Only provide an "Undecided" review when necessary.

1. You should have received an automated email from usastaffingoffice@opm.gov with the subject line “Review XXX is pending.” Click the link in the email to http://usastaffing.gov and sign in.
2. Select the list of applicants and click "Review Lists".
3. Next to the first applicant's name, click the "Documents" bubble to see a list of their documents, where you'll find their resume. Click the document to review it.
4. After each review, click the "Notes" bubble in the applicant’s row and *without viewing other notes,* add one of these notes:
	- **When the resume reflects the required competencies:** “Pass: Required proficiency levels within the competencies are reflected and warrant further evaluation.”
	- **When the resume does not reflect the required competencies:** “Does Not Pass” with a note indicating the reason, tying back to the missing competencies or proficiency levels, such as: “Does Not Pass: The applicant’s resume does not reflect the required proficiency level for product delivery because they've launched one product at one agency. The role requires proficiency of multiple product launches at multiple agencies.”
	•	**When you can't decide whether to pass or not pass:** “Undecided” with a note indicating why, such as: “Undecided: I am unsure if the applicant’s resume meets the required proficiency level. An additional SME must review.”
5. When your note is completed, check for another note, indicating the resume was previously scored by the other SME.
  - **If you are the first SME to review the applicant:** Move on to the next applicant and take no action.
  - **If another SME previously reviewed the applicant:** Use the "Resume Review Final Score Table" below to determine if a tiebreaker is needed, and indicate that the applicant review is finished by adding a checkmark, or that a tiebreaker is needed by adding a flag.
6. When you've reviewed all applicants, change your status at the bottom of the page to “Complete”.
7. Email your HR specialist to let them know your resume reviews are finished.
