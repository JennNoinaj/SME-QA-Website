description: Advice on interviewing people you know, supervise, or work with.
---

People can interview people they know, supervise, and work with (contract professionals or federal employees) as long as:

1. There is no personal relationship outside of work (known or unknown to others)
and
2. No appearance of bias (if everyone knows the SME always fights with this applicant at work or everyone knows the SME and the applicant have a special bond at work).

Going out to office happy hours after work with people you interview is fine. But if you're drinking buddies you should recuse yourself.

If a SME interviews someone they know in these qualifications interviews, the SME must only consider their interview responses in qualifying them and not other knowledge about how they perform. This is an examination that everyone must pass based on how they respond to the questions and set proficiency levels. The SMEs can make some assumptions about qualifying them based on the answers given but not use experience not mentioned that they otherwise know about to qualify them.

Hiring managers can choose to conduct additional interviews if they want to (after the certificate) and can consider past performance, personal knowledge of how they work with others, etc in those interviews. But the point of our pre-cert qualifications interviews is to assess them against the bar we set during job analysis of whatâ€™s required from day one in the job.
