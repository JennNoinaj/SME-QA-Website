title: Providing a Tiebreaker Resume Review
description: What to do when the scores for the first two resume reviews result in a tie.
---

When the scores for the first two resume reviews result in a tie, a third SME will provide a review of those applicants' resumes. The tiebreaker SME may *only* provide a score of "Pass" or "Does Not Pass."

1. You should have received an automated email from usastaffingoffice@opm.gov with the subject line “Review XXX is pending.” Click the link in the email to http://usastaffing.gov and sign in.
2. Select the list of applicants and click "Review Lists".
3. Next to the first applicant with a flag, click the "Documents" bubble to see a list of their documents, where you'll find their resume. Click the document to review it.
4. After each review, click the "Notes" bubble in the applicant’s row and *without viewing other notes,* add one of these notes:
	- **When the resume reflects the required competencies:** “Pass: Required proficiency levels within the competencies are reflected and warrant further evaluation”
	- **When the resume does not reflect the required competencies:** “Does Not Pass” with a note indicating the reason, tying back to the missing competencies or proficiency levels, such as: “Does Not Pass: The applicant’s resume does not reflect the required proficiency level for product delivery because they've launched one product at one agency. The role requires proficiency of multiple product launches at multiple agencies.”
5. Leave the flag at the end of the row selected.
6. Click the checkmark at the end of the row to indicate your review is complete for that applicant.
7. When you've reviewed all applicants, change your status at the bottom of the page to “Complete”.
8. Email your HR specialist to let them know your resume reviews are finished.
