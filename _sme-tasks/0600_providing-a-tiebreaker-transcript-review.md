title: Providing a Tiebreaker Transcript Review
description: What to do when the scores for the first two interviews result in a tie.
---

When the scores for the first two interviews result in a tie, a third SME will provide a review of those applicants' interview transcripts. The tiebreaker SME may *only* provide a score of 1 or 2 (does not pass) or 4 or 5 (pass).

1. You should have received an automated email from usastaffingoffice@opm.gov with the subject line “Review XXX is pending.” Click the link in the email to http://usastaffing.gov and sign in.
2. Select the list of applicants and click "Review Lists".
3. Next to the first applicant with a flag at the end of the row, click the black "Documents" link on the top of the USA Staffing page and download the two transcripts for this applicant.
4. Read each transcript and make a determination about the applicant’s qualifications.
  - **When the transcripts meet the required competencies:** Provide a 4 or 5, along with a sentence explaining how the candidate meets the competencies.
  - **When the transcripts do not reflect the required competencies:** Provide a 1 or 2, along with a strong note indicating why.
5. Leave the flag at the end of the row selected, but also click the checkmark at the end of the row to indicate your review is complete for that applicant.
7. When you've reviewed all applicants, change your status at the bottom of the page to “Complete”.
8. Email your HR specialist to let them know your transcript reviews are finished.
