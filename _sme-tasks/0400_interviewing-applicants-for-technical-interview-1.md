---

You are part of an SME pool that will provide the first round of interviews for the applicants who passed resume review. If the applicant does not pass the first interview, they will not continue through to the second interview.

1. You should have received an automated email from usastaffingoffice@opm.gov with the subject line “Review XXX is pending.” Click the link in the email to http://usastaffing.gov and sign in.
2. Select the list of applicants and click "Review Lists".
3. In the applicant list, find the name of the applicant you're interviewing.
4. Save a copy of the provided interview scoring template.
5. Call the provided number for the applicant at the scheduled time. Use the structured interview script for your phone interview, and transcribe everything the applicant says during the phone call. You can add factual notes about the applicant's behavior to the transcript but do not add personal commentary about the applicant to the transcript.
6. When the interview is complete, assess whether the applicant meets the required proficiency levels for the competencies needed for this position. Write the interview score, and a paragraph about how the applicant does or does not meet the required proficiency levels to the scoring template.
7. In USA Staffing, paste your overall score and summary notes into the "Notes" bubble.
8. Upload your interview template document, including the transcript, to the black Documents tab.
9. When all interviews are finished, change your status at the bottom of the page to "Complete".
10. Email your HR specialist to let them know your interviews are finished.
