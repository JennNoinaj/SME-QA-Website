## Resume Ratings

**Move Forward:** Required competencies and proficiency levels adequately reflected to warrant further evaluation.

**Borderline:**	Meets or exceeds most competencies, but remaining competencies could not be accurately assessed.

**Does Not Move Forward:**	Required competencies and proficiency levels not adequately reflected; no further evaluation recommended.


## Providing Written Justification

Review the resume for evidence of the identified competencies at the proficiency level specified for this position using the Rating Guide. You’re making a judgment call based on the established competencies, proficiencies, and your experience as an SME.

You should document clearly in the applicant notes why you determined that the applicant does or does not move forward. You are not required or expected to create a checklist of the competencies and proficiencies, nor to find explicit keywords.  


## Parentheticals

Some positions allow applicants to select multiple parentheticals. Make sure you are evaluating the resume for the competencies of the parentheticals selected, and that your note reflects this review. You can move applicants forward for some parentheticals but not the others, as long as they meet the five core competencies.


## Moving an Applicant Forward

You can determine that the competencies are met based on the context and experience described in the resume.  When deciding to move an applicant forward, you may experience two kinds of resumes: one that reflects the competencies and proficiency levels needed with limited speculation, or one that appears to meet them but you need to make major assumptions. When the decision to move forward is clear, the documentation needed is straightforward. When it’s not clear, the documentation should reflect what assumptions made.

If you judge (with **limited speculation**) that the resume meets the requirements:

> Example Note: "Move Forward: Required competencies and proficiency levels adequately reflected for both the generalist and the two selected parentheticals to warrant further evaluation."

If you judge (with **major assumptions**) that the resume meets the requirements:

> Example Note: “Move Forward (Generalist and Policy and Planning): It appears Annie has sufficient experience with IT practices, technical communication, analytical ability, and policy. Meets managing without authority and stakeholder engagement because she implemented a company-wide program that had success results and metrics.
Does not move forward (data): Resume shows no evidence of data analysis at the required proficiency level.”

## Choosing Not to Move an Applicant Forward

Always use 1-3 strong sentences to justify why, in your experience, they do not meet the required competencies/proficiency levels.

> Example: “Does Not Move Forward (all parentheticals): Though Eugene’s resume shows 43 years experience as an IT Specialist, there is no evidence that he is experienced at managing without authority or effective stakeholder engagement at the levels required by the position.”

In addition, a resume is a demonstration of the applicant’s experience and skills. If the applicant has the requisite experience for most competencies, but the resume contains major grammatical issues, you may use your judgement to determine that the applicant is not proficient in competencies like “technical communication.” Document that the applicant shouldn’t move forward, and why.

> Example: “Does Not Move Forward (Generalist): Kevin’s resume does not show technical communication skills at the level required for this position because it contains multiple spelling and grammatical errors.”


## Making a Borderline Determination

When you are simply unable to assess at least one competency, but the other competencies are being met or exceeded, then the note should explain which competency (or competencies) cannot be assessed and why.

>Example: “Borderline: Though applicant meets or exceeds most competencies, I am unable to assess managing w/o authority because I am unable to determine what technical communication skills he might have.”
